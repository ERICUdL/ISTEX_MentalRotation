The question of whether these different areas are truly simultaneously active or whether they are temporally distinct and might reflect different steps of information processing cannot be answered by these imaging methods. We applied spatiotemporal analysis techniques to multichannel event\u2010related potential (ERP) recordings in order to elucidate the topography and chronology of brain processes involved in mental rotation. We measured 41\u2010electrode ERPs in 12 healthy subjects who had to evaluate whether rotated letters were in a normal or mirror\u2010reflected position. These figures were presented in the left, right, or central visual fields and were randomly rotated by 0\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 100\u00b0, or 150\u00b0. Behaviorally, we replicated the observation that reaction time increases with greater angles of rotation. Electrophysiologically, we identified a set of dominant electric potential distributions, each of them stable for a certain time period. Only one of these time segments (appearing between 400\u2013600 msec) increased significantly in duration with greater angles of rotation mirroring reaction time. We suggest that the rotation of mental images is carried out during this time segment. A general linear inverse solution applied to this segment showed occipito\u2010parietal cerebral activity that was lateralized to the right hemisphere. Hum.

This new work is typically conducting basic research into aspects of the human mind and brain. The present review features as examples of such integrations two series of studies by the author and his colleagues. One series, employing object recognition, mental motor imagery, and mental rotation paradigms, clarifies the nature of a cognitive process, imagined spatial transformations used in shape recognition. Among other implications, it suggests that when recognizing a hand's handedness, imagining one's body movement depends on cerebrally lateralized sensory-motor structures and deciding upon handedness depends on exact match shape confirmation. The other series, using cutaneous, tactile, and auditory pitch discrimination paradigms, elucidates the function of a brain structure, the cerebellum. It suggests that the cerebellum has non-motor sensory support functions upon which optimally fine sensory discriminations depend. In addition, six key issues for this integrative approach are reviewed. These include arguments for the value and greater use of: rigorous quantitative meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies; stereotactic coordinate-based data, as opposed to surface landmark-based data; standardized vocabularies capturing the elementary component operations of cognitive and behavioral tasks; functional hypotheses about brain areas that are consistent with underlying microcircuitry; an awareness that not all brain areas implicated by neuroimaging or neurology are necessarily directly involved in the associated cognitive or behavioral task; and systematic approaches to integrations of this kind.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "107", "title": "Acta Psychologica", "corpusName": "elsevier"}, "publicationDate": "2001", "authors": [{"name": "Lawrence M.

In a second paradigm, subjects mentally rotated and compared pairs of figurative stimuli to determine whether the stimuli were identical or mirror-images. In both paradigms, rCBF was compared with a control task that used identical stimuli, but required no mental rotation. Mental rotation of single alphanumeric stimuli engendered activation in the primary somatomotor area in the left precentral gyrus. Mental rotation of paired figures engendered activation in the left superior parietal lobule and the right frontal medial gyrus. A deactivated area was located in the medial part of the left superior frontal gyrus. Comparison of both paradigms revealed that the left gyrus precentralis was activated significantly during the alphanumeric condition and that the left gyrus lingualis was significantly activated during the paired figures condition. Motor processes may be an inherent part of every mental rotation but the type of motor involvement appears strongly dependent on the specific task or the specific stimuli.

In the posterior parietal cortex, it has been suggested that the superior parietal lobule (SPL) underlies VI, whereas MI relies on the supramarginalis gyrus (SMG). However, because several brain imaging studies have also shown an overlap of activations in SPL and SMG during VI or MI, the question arises as to which extent these 2 subregions really contribute to distinct imagery processes. To address this issue, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce virtual lesions of either SMG or SPL in subjects performing a MI (hand drawing rotation) or a VI (letter rotation) task. Whatever hemisphere was stimulated, SMG lesions selectively altered MI, whereas SPL lesions only affected VI, demonstrating a double dissociation between MI and VI.

Although there is some support for a right-hemispheric bias, at least for the holistic rotation of relatively simple shapes, it is unlikely that this bias approaches the degree of left-hemispheric dominance for language-related skills. An evolutionary scenario is sketched in which the characteristically symbolic mode of the left hemisphere evolved relatively late and achieved the quality of recursive generativity only in the late stages of hominid evolution.

There were also small cycle-related enhancements in performance for these women on the mental rotation test that may reflect cyclical increases in estrogen and progesterone. Additional analyses showed an inverted U-shaped function in level of estradiol and the Cattell Test. Finally, for women who were tested on Day 10 of their menstrual cycle, there was a negative linear relationship between their Cattell scores and level of progesterone. Stereotypes about the cognitive abilities of males and females did not correspond to performance on the mental rotation or Finding A's Test, so the sex-typical results could not be attributed to either stereotype threat or stereotype activation.

Five hundred first year students of medicine (n = 242, intervention) and educational sciences (n = 258, control) participated in a pretest and posttest MRT, 1 month apart. During this month, the intervention group studied anatomy and the control group studied research methods for the social sciences. In the pretest, the intervention group scored 14.40 (SD: \u00b1 3.37) and the control group 13.17 (SD: \u00b1 3.36) on a scale of 20, which is a significant difference (t\u2010test, t = 4.07, df = 498, P < 0.001). Both groups show an improvement on the posttest compared to the pretest (paired samples t\u2010test, t = 12.21/14.71, df = 257/241, P < 0.001). The improvement in the intervention group is significantly higher (ANCOVA, F = 16.59, df = 1;497, P < 0.001). It is concluded that (1) medical students studying anatomy show greater improvement between two consecutive MRTs than educational science students; (2) medical students have a higher spatial ability than educational sciences students; and (3) if a MRT is repeated there seems to be a test effect. It is concluded that spatial ability may be trained by studying anatomy. The overarching message for anatomy teachers is that a good spatial ability is beneficial for learning anatomy and learning anatomy may be beneficial for students' spatial ability. This reciprocal advantage implies that challenging students on spatial aspects of anatomical knowledge could have a twofold effect on their learning.

One of currently preferred hypotheses is that the menstrual cycle hormones modulate functional hemispheric lateralization. We examined six male and six female subjects by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to image cortical activation patterns associated with cognitive and motor activation to determine whether these changes during the menstrual cycle can be visualized. Female subjects, who did not use oral contraceptives, were scanned twice, once during the menses and once on the 11/12 day of the menstrual cycle. A word-stem-completion task, a mental rotation task and a simple motor task were performed by all subjects. Our data provide evidence that the menstrual cycle hormones influence the overall level of cerebral hemodynamics to a much stronger degree than they influence the activation pattern itself. No differences were seen between male subjects and female subjects during the low estrogen phase. During both neuropsychological tasks blood estrogenlevel had a profound effect on the size but not on the lateralization or the localization of cortical activation patterns. The female brain under estrogen showed a marked increase in perfusion in cortical areasinvolved in both cognitive tasks, whereas the hemodynamic effects during the motor tasks were less pronounced.

Initial results showed no differences after treatment between placebo or estradiol treated subjects. However, within treatment group analysis revealed that estradiol treated subjects who reached higher estradiol levels (larger than 29 pg/ml) performed significantly better after treatment in the delayed recall of the paired associate test (verbal memory) than subjects who reached lower estradiol levels (P<0.05). A nonsignificant trend was observed for the immediate recall condition (P<0.10) These findings were strengthened by correlations between treatment-induced estradiol levels and changes in verbal memory performance.

Four\u2010year\u2010olds, 6\u2010year\u2010olds, and adults were given a mental rotation task in the form of a computer game, but with no instructions to use mental rotation and no other references to mental activity. During the task, participants were asked to explain how they made their judgments. Reaction time patterns and verbal reports revealed that 6\u2010year\u2010olds were comparable to adults both in their spontaneous use and subjective awareness of mental rotation. Four\u2010year\u2010olds who referred to mental activity to explain their performance had reaction time and error patterns consistent with mental rotation; 4\u2010year\u2010olds who did not refer to mental activity responded randomly. A second study with 5\u2010year\u2010olds produced similar results. This research demonstrates that conscious access to at least 1 type of thinking is present earlier than previously recognized. It also helps to clarify the conditions under which young children will and will not notice and report their mental activity. These findings have implications for competing accounts of children's developing understanding of the mind and for the \u201cimagery debate.\u201d", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "69", "title": "Child Development", "corpusName": "wiley"}, "publicationDate": "1998", "authors": [{"name": "David Estes"}], "KeyWords": ["Young", "Children's", "Awareness", "Mental", "Activity:", "Case", "Mental", "Rotation"]},

However, also after correct trials, an Ne\u2010like wave is seen, called CRN or Nc, which is much smaller than the Ne. This study tested the hypothesis whether Ne and Nc reflect the same functional process, and whether this process is linked to online response control. For this purpose, independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized with the EEG data of two types of reaction tasks: a flanker task and a mental rotation task. To control for speed\u2010accuracy effects, speed and accuracy instructions were balanced in a between subjects design. For both tasks ICA and dipole analysis revealed one component (Ne\u2010IC) explaining most of the variance for the difference between correct and erroneous trials. The Ne\u2010IC showed virtually the same features as the raw postresponse ERP, being larger for erroneous compared to correct trials and for the flanker than for the rotation task. In addition, it peaked earlier for corrected than for uncorrected errors. The results favor the hypothesis that Ne and Nc reflect the same process, which is modulated by response correctness and type of task. On the basis of the literature and the present results, we assume that this process induces online response control, which is much stronger in error than correct trials and with direct rather than indirect stimulus response mapping.

The poorer performance of women in the luteal phase was not related to differences in ratings of perceived stress, perceived success on the test, or mood.

To further explore the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia we compared mental rotation of body parts and sensory temporal discrimination in 11 patients with fixed dystonia, 11 patients with classical mobile dystonia and 10 healthy controls. In the mental rotation task subjects were presented with realistic photos of left or right hands, feet and the head of a young women with a black patch covering the left or the right eye in six different orientations. Subjects had to verbally report the laterality of the presented stimuli. To assess sensory temporal discrimination subjects were asked to discriminate whether pairs of visual, tactile (electrical), or visuo\u2010tactile stimuli were simultaneous or sequential (temporal discrimination threshold) and in the latter case which stimulus preceded the other (temporal order judgement). In accordance with previous studies patients with mobile dystonia were abnormal in mental rotation and temporal discrimination, whereas patients with fixed dystonia were only impaired in mental rotation. Possible explanations for this deficit may include the influence of the abnormal body posture itself, a shared predisposing pathophysiology for mobile and fixed dystonia, or a body image disturbance.

Among different types of neural networks compatible with the known functional and architectural properties of the cortex, we show that there exist interesting bayesian solutions resulting in an optimal collective decision made by the neuronal population. We suggest that thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical synaptic plasticity can be differentially modulated to optimize this collective bayesian decision process. We take two examples of cortical dynamics, one for perceptual grouping in MT, and the other one for mental rotation in M1.

To account for this differential performance, the authors advanced two alternative explanations. The first was a \u2018Spatial Stroop\u2019 effect which suggested that, because of their enhanced spatial ability, males are especially disadvantaged in escaping the misleading visual feedback provided by the mirror, resulting in slower and less accurate tracings. The second was a \u2018manipulospatial\u2019 hypothesis which suggested that the tracing advantage was related to female superiority in fine-detailed motor control, and perhaps, differential practice at performing skilled motor tasks in mirror-reversed contexts. In the present study, two experiments were conducted to assess the relative viability of these explanations. In Experiment 1, the WAIS-R Block Design task was performed within and outside the context of a mirror. This was done to determine if the observed female advantage was restricted to mirror-tracing per se, or generalizable to other manipulospatial tasks. In Experiment 2, a mental rotation task was performed within and outside the context of a mirror. The latter was designed to reveal if the removal of the motor component would affect the obtained sex difference. The present findings suggest that as long as some form of precision motor manipulation is required, females are superior to males at mirror-reversed spatial tasks.

Limitations on the concurrent performance of two unrelated tasks challenge the tacitly assumed independence of two brain systems that seemingly have little overlap. The current study used fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure cortical activation during the concurrent performance of two high-level cognitive tasks that involve different sensory modalities and activate largely nonoverlapping areas of sensory and association cortex. One task was auditory sentence comprehension, and the other was the mental rotation of visually depicted 3-D objects. If the neural systems underlying the two tasks functioned independently, then in the dual task the brain activation in the main areas supporting the cognitive processing should be approximately the conjunction of the activation for each of the two tasks performed alone. We found instead that in the dual task, the activation in association areas (primarily temporal and parietal areas of cortex) was substantially less than the sum of the activation when the two tasks were performed alone, suggesting some mutual constraint among association areas.

However, we know very little about how these representations use information about location, one of the most important spatial properties. Three experiments explored how location information is incorporated into image representations. All of these experiments used a mental rotation task in which the location of the stimulus varied from trial to trial. If images are location specific, these changes should affect the way images are used. The effects from image representations were separated from those of general spatial attention mechanisms by shape. With shape information, subjects could use an image as a template, and they recognized the stimulus more quickly when it was at the same location as the image. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects were able to use visual image representations effectively without knowing where the stimulus would appear, but left open the possibility that image location must be adjusted before use. In Experiment 2, distance between the stimulus location and the image location was varied systematically, and response time increased with distance. Therefore image representations appear to be location-specific, though the represented location can be adjusted easily. In Experiment 3, a saccade was introduced between the image cue and the test stimulus, in order to test wether subjects responded more quickly when the test stimulus appeared at the same retinotopic location or same spatiotopic location as the cue. The results suggest that the location is coded retinotopically in image representations.

Three major factors were considered: (1) visualization ability (VZ) of learners, (2) dynamism of the visual display, and (3) interactivity of the system. Participants (N = 60) of differing VZs (high, low) studied a group of anatomical structures in one of three visual conditions (control, static, dynamic) and one of two interactive conditions (interactive, non\u2010interactive).

The Motor\u2010Free Visual Perception Test\u2013Revised (MVPT\u2010R) provides measures of overall visual perceptual processing ability. It incorporates different cognitive elements including visual discrimination, spatial relationships, and mental rotation. We used the MVPT\u2010R to study brain activation patterns in healthy controls (1) sober, and (2) at two doses of alcohol intoxication with event\u2010related fMRI. The fMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model approach based upon a model of the time course and a hemodynamic response estimate. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed to examine dose\u2010dependent amplitude changes. With regard to alcohol\u2010free task\u2010related brain activation, we replicate our previous finding in which SPM group analysis revealed robust activation in visual and visual association areas, frontal eye field (FEF)/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the supplemental motor area (SMA). Consistent with a previous study of EtOH and visual stimulation, EtOH resulted in a dose\u2010dependent decrease in activation amplitude over much of the visual perception network and in a decrease in the maximum contrast\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (in the lingual gyrus). Despite only modest behavior changes (in the expected direction), significant dose\u2010dependent activation increases were observed in insula, DLPFC, and precentral regions, whereas dose\u2010dependent activation decreases were observed in anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus, and middle frontal areas. Some areas (FEF/DLPFC/SMA) became more diffusely activated (i.e., increased in spatial extent) at the higher dose.

A developmental amnesic case with focal bilateral hippocampal pathology showed a massive additional impairment when tested from the shifted viewpoint compared with a mild, list length\u2010dependent, impairment when tested from the same viewpoint. While the same\u2010view condition could be solved by visual pattern matching, the shifted\u2010view condition requires a viewpoint independent representation or an equivalent mechanism for translating or rotating viewpoints in memory. The latter mechanism was indicated by control subjects' response latencies in the shifted\u2010view condition, although the amnesic case is not impaired in tests of mental rotation of single objects. These results show that the human hippocampus supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory, and suggest that it does so by providing a mechanism for viewpoint manipulation in memory.

Mental rotation of the hands can be used as a tool to investigate body schema. Research has shown that implicit motor imagery (i.e., mental simulated movements) can be generated based on the body schema, by combining both stored and incoming sensory information. Multimodal stimulation of peripersonal space has also served as an experimental paradigm for the study of body schema. Perception of peripersonal space is based on body\u2010part\u2010centered space coding that is considered as a manifestation of the body schema, its function being to integrate visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and perhaps motor plans as well. By combining such experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques, research has converged to show that the parietal association cortex and premotor cortex are important for the body schema. Multimodal perception of body parts and peripersonal space have been also studied in relation to prism adaptation and tool use effects, indicating a clear modifiability of the body schema. Following prolonged adaptation to reversed vision, a reversed hand representation can be added to the body schema like a tool.

Thirty-three neurosurgical patients (17 left temporal lobectomy, LTL; 16 right temporal lobectomy, RTL) and 16 controls were tested on a number of blindfolded tasks designed to investigate path integration and on a number of additional control tasks (assessing mental rotation and left\u2013right orientation).

The magnitude of angular difference in depth that is depicted between two static shapes has been thought to predict mean response time for same-different comparisons on shapes in the mental rotation effect. The tandem rotation effect provides a counterexample to that hypothesis. Two planar shapes are depicted as separated by a small and fixed angular difference in depth; the pair of shapes is then depicted as tilted in depth. Mean response time to compare these shapes varies nearly linearly with the magnitude of the yoked rotation - though angular difference is held constant. The slope of this response time function is very close to that for single rotation in depth. The tandem effect supports a claim that mean response time varies as a function of the change in area of planar shapes that are depicted to rotate away from the picture plane, rather than as a function of the angular difference of one shape from another. The tandem rotation effect is not found to obtain for rotations in the picture plane. A conclusion drawn from these and other results is that an hypothesis of mental rotation is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain changes in response times for the simultaneous comparison of planar shapes pictured in depth. A piecewise continuous trigonometric function is proposed to describe response times for the comparison of planar shapes that are depicted to rotate in depth.

Based on predictions from Casey and Brabeck's (1990) theory of sex differences, the study was also designed to identify a target group of right-handed girls with the optimal combination of genetic and environmental factors (high math/science achievers with nonright-handed immediate relatives). They were predicted to show strategies and performance more similar to those of the boys than to those of both the low math/science achieving girls and the high math/science girls with all right-handed immediate relatives (predicted to have the nonoptimal genotype).

This provided a basis for comparing the groups on the use of visual-spatial or verbal strategies on the mental rotation task. The boys: (1) did not show a significant advantage over the girls on the mental rotation items, but (2) did depend more on visual-spatial strategies than the girls, and (3) depended less on verbal strategies than the girls.

Psychol., 19 (1987) 178\u2013241.], in order to identify handedness, subjects mentally rotated their own hand until it matched with the presented one. This process was confirmatory, being preceded by an implicit visual analysis of the target hand. Presentation of hands holding objects with congruent or incongruent types of grip influenced handedness recognition at different stages in right-handed and left-handed subjects. That is, the mental rotation stage was affected in right-handed subjects, whereas the initial phase of implicit hand analysis was affected in left-handed subjects. We suggest that in handedness recognition, left-handers relied more on a pictorial hand representation, whereas right-handers relied more on a pragmatic hand representation, probably derived from experience in the control of their own movements.

However, doubts have been expressed concerning prosopagnosics' preserved ability to recognize unfamiliar faces and to make other within category discriminations. The present study pursues these doubts. If recognition of unfamiliar faces and objects is intact, then prosopagnosics should demonstrate normal processing for all tasks that depend on the possession of intact stored visual descriptions at the category level. In particular, they should show normal face and object superiority effects. A detailed investigation was carried out on a well documented prosopagnosic (KD) and less extensively on three other (RB, AH and OA) well attested cases. Experiments 1 and 2 considered whether face and object superiority effects were observed in these patients. No difference in the pattern of recognition performance was found between normal and unusual arrangements of faces and objects. Their pattern of performance differed both from unilateral brain-damaged patients and normal controls. The results suggest both that these prosopagnosic patients were impaired on the recognition of unfamiliar faces and that their problem is not specific to faces. Experiment 3 showed that KD was impaired on a face/non-face decision task but appeared to benefit by the stimulus being presented in the normal orientation. For normal controls, mental rotation of a face appeared to be a separate process from face categorization. Experiment 4 found that KD, AH and OA were impaired, compared to normal controls, in their ability to recognize emotional expressions but not more than brain-damaged controls. The impairment of the prosopagnosics tested in the present study is placed at the interaction between stored object descriptions and the structural encoding stage of Bruce and Young.

To determine if cortical processing, as indicated by response time to a mental rotation reaction-time task, is altered by an upper cervical toggle recoil adjustment. Design: Prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Chiropractic college clinical training facility. Participants: Thirty-six chiropractic student volunteers with clinical evidence of upper cervical joint dysfunction. Intervention: Participants in the experimental group received a high-velocity, low-amplitude upper cervical adjustment. A non-intervention group was used to control for improvement in the mental rotation task as a result of practice effects. Outcome measures: Reaction time was measured for randomly varying angular orientations of an object appearing either as normal or mirror-reversed on a computer screen. Results: The average decrease in mental rotation reaction time for the experimental group was 98 ms, a 14.9% improvement, whereas the average decrease in mental rotation reaction time for the control group was 58 ms, an 8.0 improvement. The difference scores after the intervention time were significantly greater for the experimental group compared with the control group, as indicated by a one-tailed, 2-sample, equal variance Student t test, (P < 05). Conclusion: The results of this study have demonstrated a significant improvement in a complex reaction-time task after an upper cervical adjustment.

In mirror agnosia, the patients always reached toward the virtual object in the mirror and they were not capable of changing their behavior even after presentation of the position of the object in real visual space. In mirror ataxia (resembling optic ataxia) although some patients initially tended to reach for the virtual object in the mirror, they soon learned to guide their arms toward the real object, all of them producing many directional errors. Both patient groups performed poorly on mental rotation, but only the patients with mirror agnosia were impaired in line orientation. Only 1 of the patients suffered from neglect and 3 from apraxia.

They then performed a lateralized two-dimensional mental rotation task. The results showed the typical mental rotation function in that angle of rotation and reaction time were linearly related.

A significant three-way interaction of gender, spatial ability, and angle of rotation reflected the fact that low spatial males were more profoundly affected by rotation than the other groups.

In this article we examine these hypotheses by placing them against the evidence for the neurological basis for the sex difference and the archaeological evidence for the evolution of spatial thinking in general. Given the probable source of the neurological difference in the timing of fetal testosterone, hypotheses that emphasize selection for female cognitive abilities are handicapped from the start. The hypotheses favoring male hunting and male reproductive strategy stumble when evaluated in light of the timing of the evolution of spatial cognition; archaeological evidence for the proposed selective behaviors and for the spatial abilities in question (e.g., mental rotation) do not correspond in a way that would permit a link between them. We conclude that none of the proposed adaptationist hypotheses fit the evidence as it currently exists, and that the modern sex difference in spatial cognition is almost certainly an evolutionary by\u2010product of selection for optimal rates of fetal development. \u00a9 1996 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "101", "title": "American Journal of Physical Anthropology", "corpusName": "wiley"}, "publicationDate": "1996", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas G.

However, little is known about how experiences and gender\u2010role stereotypes mediate performance differences in this area. Aim: The relationship between specific experiences (spatial activities, computer experience), achievement\u2010related attitudes, and spatial abilities, i.e., mental\u2010rotation ability was investigated with males and females in different academic subgroups. Sample: The sample comprised 112 female and 71 male undergraduates, majoring in arts, humanities and social sciences, sports, psychology and computational visualistics. Methods: A redrawn version of the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was administered and the participants completed a questionnaire about their spatial activities, computer experience, self\u2010ratings regarding everyday spatial abilities, and attitudes towards mathematics and physics. Results: Mental Rotations Test performance was mainly affected by academic programme and gender, but the effect size of gender differences varied. It was largest with students majoring in arts, humanities and social sciences and smallest with those majoring in computational visualistics. Data analyses revealed statistically significant correlations with spatial activities and computer experience only for females. The relationship between test performance and scales of achievement\u2010related self\u2010concept also depended on gender.

Previous studies have already demonstrated the impact of view, orientation and part occlusion on individual cells. We consider the cells as a population providing evidence in the form of neuronal activity for perceptual decisions related to recognition. The time course of neural responses to stimuli provides an explanation of the variation in speed of recognition across different viewing circumstances that is seen in behavioural experiments. A simple unifying explanation of the behavioural effects is that the speed of recognition of an object depends on the rate of accumulation of activity from neurones selective for the object, evoked by a particular viewing circumstance. This in turn depends on the extent that the object has been seen previously under the particular circumstance. For any familiar object, more cells will be tuned to the configuration of the object's features present in the view or views most frequently experienced. Therefore, activity amongst the population of cells selective for the object's appearance will accumulate more slowly when the object is seen in an unusual view, orientation or size. This accounts for the increased time to recognise rotated views without the need to postulate `mental rotation' or `transformations' of novel views to align with neural representations of familiar views.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "67", "title": "Cognition", "corpusName": "elsevier"}, "publicationDate": "1998", "authors": [{"name": "D.I Perrett"}, {"name": "M.W Oram"}, {"name": "E Ashbridge"}], "KeyWords": ["Evidence", "accumulation", "cell", "populations", "responsive", "faces:", "account", "generalisation", "recognition", "without", "mental", "transformations"]},

Results: In the Benton line orientation test, a test of sensory analysis and elementary perception, no deficits were present in subjects with cerebellar damage. In MIN, which analyses the capacity to process bidimensional complex figures mentally, and in the DAT, which is based on mental folding and manipulation of tridimensional stimuli, subjects with cerebellar damage were impaired. Conclusions: The results indicate that lesions of the cerebellar circuits affect visuospatial ability. The ability to rotate objects mentally is a possible functional substrate of the observed deficits. A comparison between visuospatial performance of subjects with focal right and left cerebellar lesions shows side differences in the characteristics of the visuospatial syndrome.

These structures are severely impaired in several movement disorders, including dystonia. Writer's cramp is the most common form of focal hand dystonia. This study investigates whether patients affected by writer's cramp present with difficulties in tasks involving mental rotation of body parts and whether any impairments are specific to the affected hand or generalized to other body parts. For this purpose we tested 15 patients with right writer's cramp (aged 21\u201368 years, 8 women) and 15 healthy control subjects (10 women, age and education matched). Stimuli consisted of realistic photographs of hands and feet presented on a computer monitor in different orientations with respect to the upright canonical orientation. In each trial, subjects gave a laterality judgement by reporting verbally whether the presented body part was left or right. Two main results of the study are, firstly, writer's cramp patients are slower than controls in mentally rotating hands [F (1,28) = 5.4; P = 0.028] but not feet, and secondly, the pattern of response times to stimuli at various orientations suggests that the mental motor imagery of controls and patients reflects the type of processes and mechanisms called into play during actual execution of the same movements. In particular, increased difficulty in rotating right-sided stimuli at 120\u00b0 and left-sided stimuli at 240\u00b0 would suggest that mental rotation of body parts reflects the anatomical constraints of real hand movements. In conclusion, patients with writer's cramp presented mental rotation deficits specific to the hand.

We found that mean reaction times and error rates increased with angle of rotation depending on the actual biomechanical constraints of the hand but suprathreshold TMS had no influence on task performance regardless of the timing of TMS. However, the excitability of the corticomotor output from the left M1\u2010HAND was modulated during the reaction.

The group learning from the model performed significantly better than the other two groups on the nominal questions (Model 67%; KV 40%; VR 41%, Effect size 1.19 and 1.29, respectively). There was no difference between the KV and VR groups. There was no difference between the groups on the functional questions (Model 28%; KV, 23%, VR 25%). Computer\u2010based learning resources appear to have significant disadvantages compared to traditional specimens in learning nominal anatomy. Consistent with previous research, virtual reality shows no advantage over static presentation of key views.

Modified worked examples proved superior to conventional worked examples without intermediate stages while conventional worked examples were, in turn, superior to problems.

In a dual task paradigm, participants were instructed to focus either on auditory sentence comprehension, mental rotation, or both. One of the major findings is that the distribution of brain activation was amenable to strategic control, such that the amount of activation per task was systematically related to the attention\u2010dividing instructions. The activation in language processing regions was lower when attending to mental rotation than when attending to the sentences, and the activation in visuospatial processing regions was lower when attending to sentences than when attending to mental rotations. Additionally, the activation was found to be underadditive, with the dual\u2010task condition eliciting less activation than the sum of the attend sentence and attend rotation conditions. We also observed a laterality shift across conditions within language\u2010processing regions, with the attend sentence condition showing bilateral activation, while the dual task condition showed a left hemispheric dominance. This shift suggests multiple language\u2010processing modes and may explain the underadditivity in activation observed in the current and previous studies. Hum.

A patient (H.P.) was studied, who presented the four symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome in the absence of any other neuropsychological disorders. MRI showed a focal ischaemic lesion, situated subcortically in the inferior part of the left angular gyrus and reaching the superior posterior region of T1.

The most frequent drawing mistakes were the misplacement of numbers and clock hands, which may relate to dysfunctions of the right inferior parietal cortex. The right-left orientation (RLO) for the own body was not deteriorated in AD patients.

Given the extensive evidence suggesting ASDs are characterized by abnormal neural connectivity, this study aimed to investigate network connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD. Twenty\u2010two males with ASD without intellectual disability and 22 individually matched controls performed a mental rotation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in which two rotated stimuli were judged to be same (\u201cSame Trials\u201d) or mirror\u2010imaged (\u201cMirror Trials\u201d). Behavioral results revealed a relative advantage of mental rotation in the ASD group\u2014controls were slower responding to the more difficult Mirror Trials than Same Trials whereas the ASD group completed Mirror Trials and Same\u2010trials at similar speeds. In the ASD group, brain activity was reduced in frontal, temporal, occipital, striatal, and cerebellar regions and, consistent with previous literature, functional connectivity between a number of brain regions was reduced. However, some connections appeared to be conserved and were recruited in a qualitatively different way by the two groups. As task difficulty increased (on Mirror Trials), controls tended to increase connections between certain brain regions, whereas the ASD group appeared to suppress connections between these regions. There was an interesting exception to this pattern in the visual cortex, a finding that may suggest an advantage in early visual perceptual processing in ASD. Overall, this study has identified a relative advantage in mental rotation in ASD that is associated with aberrant neural connectivity and that may stem from enhanced visual perceptual processing.

We report the use of spatial tests for children that are similar to those that have shown large sex differences in adults and may be measuring ability comparable to adult spatial ability.

This curriculum was implemented in five nursery classes for 2 consecutive school years. Children in these classes were compared with children in classes where the program was not administered. It was hypothesized that the generative nature of the visual language developed in the experimental children would allow the children to extend the language learned to new situations and help them to solve problems in which no prior training was given. Test results confirmed this hypothesis: The effects of training in the Agam program transferred to cognitive domains in which no training was given. Specifically, the findings indicated positive effects on general intelligence and school readiness of children about to enter first grade, with especially pronounced effects in the areas of arithmetic and writing readiness. Other findings revealed an increased visual learning ability in new tasks that developed in the experimental children. Training effects did not transfer to mental rotation and to memory for realistic designs. The program was found to be equally effective for lower-class as for middle-class children. The effect of the program was greater for children who participated in the program for 2 years as compared with those who joined in the second year, indicating a cumulative effect of the program. This latter finding can also be used to refute an alternative explanation of the obtained experimental effects offered by a motivational theory.

As in previous research, a cylindrical wedge model was found to describe the underlying structure well. The facet of dimensionality was represented in a polar way with the three-dimensional tasks in the core of a radex-like configuration and the two-dimensional tests in the periphery. The facet of mental rotation was identified to play a modular role as two different subregions in the SSA solutions, one representing two-dimensional rotation and one representing three-dimensional rotation. Memory load was represented in a similar fashion in one of the projections. Speededness emerged as a separate dimension in one of the plots. Indications for the existence of one more facet were found. The results agreed quite well with findings of previous research in this area.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "11", "title": "Learning and Individual Differences", "corpusName": "elsevier"}, "publicationDate": "2000", "authors": [{"name": "Heinrich Stumpf"}, {"name": "John Eliot"}], "KeyWords": ["structural", "analysis", "visual", "spatial", "ability", "academically", "talented", "students"]},

Planning and evaluating new curricula or interventions requires understanding these skills and having the means to assess them. Prior developmental research focused primarily on one aspect of dynamic spatial transformations (DST), namely mental rotation. This study broadens our knowledge by addressing another important DST, namely mental folding. We devised a new test suitable for young children. Performance of 180 children between 4 and 7\u2009years suggests that mental folding appears at around 5.5\u2009years of age, although there were also marked individual differences. These data on the emergence of DST suggest that educational programs targeting this skill could start in preschool or kindergarten and provide a means to assess the effectiveness of such efforts.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "7", "title": "Mind, Brain, and Education", "corpusName": "wiley"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Justin Harris"}, {"name": "Nora S.

In a three\u2010phase experiment with random shapes, participants (n\u2009=\u200994) first interactively determined if two equivalent shapes were rotated or reflected; second, memorized the shape; and third, determined if an imprint in a profile view of the ground was a rotated, reflected imprint of the shape, or an imprint not matching the original shape. Participants self\u2010reported these strategies: Key feature, shape interaction, association/elaboration, holistic/perspective, divide and conquer, mental rotation/reflection and others. Participants reporting key features strategy were significantly more accurate on the computer\u2010based visuospatial WM task. These results highlight the importance of strategy in visuospatial WM.

To determine whether similar differences occur in a non-Western culture, this study administered a cross-linguistic battery of tests to high school students in Japan and America. In both cultures, girls averaged significantly higher scores on a Story Recall test, the Digit-Symbol test and a Word Fluency test whereas boys achieved significantly higher scores on a Mental Rotation test. The analysis of standardized test scores further indicated that the size of the sex difference was culture-independent in three out of these four cases.

Pictures of right and left hands were shown at angles of 0, 50, 90 and 180 degrees, and the subjects were required to indicate whether what was shown was a right hand or a left hand. It was found that, in this task, the dyslexics did not show the normal pattern of response times at different angles, and also, that they made more errors than the controls. It is argued that this result is compatible with hypothesis that, in typical cases of dyslexia, there is a malfunctioning in the posterior parietal area.
