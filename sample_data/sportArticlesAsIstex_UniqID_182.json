The present study investigated whether spatial working memory (SWM) contributes to visuomotor adaptation depending on the stage of learning. We tested the hypothesis that SWM would contribute early in the adaptation process by measuring (i) the correlation between SWM tasks and the rate of adaptation, and (ii) the overlap between the neural substrates of a SWM mental rotation task and visuomotor adaptation. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, a visuomotor adaptation task, and an SWM task involving mental rotation, with the latter two tasks performed in a 3.0-T MRI scanner. Performance on a neuropsychological test of SWM (two-dimensional mental rotation) correlated with the rate of early, but not late, visuomotor adaptation. During the early, but not late, adaptation period, participants showed overlapping brain activation with the SWM mental rotation task, in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral inferior parietal lobules.

The functional role of the primary motor cortex (M1) in mental rotation is however less clear. It has been suggested that the strategy used to mentally rotate objects determines M1 involvement. Based on the strategy hypothesis that distinguishes between an internal and an external strategy, our study was designed to specifically test the relation between strategy and M1 activity. Methods: Twenty-two subjects were asked to participate in a standard mental rotation task. We used specific picture stimuli that were supposed to trigger either the internal (e.g. pictures of hands or tools) or the external strategy (e.g. pictures of houses or abstract figures). The strategy hypothesis predicts an involvement of M1 only in case of stimuli triggering the internal strategy (imagine grasping and rotating the object by oneself). Single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was employed to quantify M1 activity during task performance by measuring Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) at the right hand muscle. Results: Contrary to the strategy hypothesis, we found no interaction between stimulus category and corticospinal excitability. Instead, corticospinal excitability was generally increased compared with a resting baseline although subjects indicated more frequent use of the external strategy for all object categories. Conclusion: This finding suggests that M1 involvement is not exclusively linked with the use of the internal strategy but rather directly with the process of mental rotation. Alternatively, our results might support the hypothesis that M1 is active due to a 'spill-over' effect from adjacent brain regions.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"title": "Behavioral and Brain Functions"}, "publicationDate": "2007", "authors": [{"name": "Stefan Bode"}, {"name": "Susan Koeneke"}, {"name": "Lutz J\u00e4ncke"}]},

Results replicated in large part previous findings that indicated that occluded items were significantly more difficult than non-occluded and that mirror items were more difficult than structural items. An item characteristic not previously examined in the literature, configuration type (homogeneous versus heterogeneous), also was found to be associated with item difficulty. Interestingly, no significant association was found between angular disparity and difficulty. Multiple regression analysis revealed that a model consisting of occlusion and configuration type alone was sufficient for explaining 53 percent of the variance in item difficulty.

Transsexualism is an extreme gender identity disorder in which individuals seek cross-gender treatment to change their sex. The aim of our study was to investigate if male-to-female (MF) and female-to-male (FM) transsexuals receiving cross-sex hormonal treatment have different patterns of cortical activation during a three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation task. An fMRI study was performed using a 3-T scan in a sample of 18 MF and 19 FM under chronic cross-sex hormonal treatment. Twenty-three males and 19 females served as controls. The general pattern of cerebral activation seen while visualizing the rotated and non-rotated figures was similar for all four groups showing strong occipito-parieto-frontal brain activation. However, compared to control males, the activation of MF transsexuals during the task was lower in the superior parietal lobe. Compared to control females, MF transsexuals showed higher activation in orbital and right dorsolateral prefrontal regions and lower activation in the left prefrontal gyrus. FM transsexuals did not differ from either the MF transsexual or control groups. Regression analyses between cerebral activation and the number of months of hormonal treatment showed a significant negative correlation in parietal, occipital and temporal regions in the MF transsexuals. No significant correlations with time were seen in the FM transsexuals. In conclusion, although we did not find a specific pattern of cerebral activation in the FM transsexuals, we have identified a specific pattern of cerebral activation during a mental 3D rotation task in MF transsexuals under cross-sex hormonal treatment that differed from control males in the parietal region and from control females in the orbital prefrontal region.

Hand-object interaction gestures were produced earlier than object-movement gestures, the rate of both types of gestures decreased, and gestures became more distant from the stimulus object over trials (Experiments 1 and 3). Furthermore, in the first few trials, object-movement gestures increased, whereas hand-object interaction gestures decreased, and this change of motor strategies was also reflected in the type of verbal description of rotation in the concurrent speech (Experiment 2). This change of motor strategies was hampered when gestures were prohibited (Experiment 4). The authors concluded that the motor strategy becomes less dependent on agentive action on the object, and also becomes internalized over the course of the experiment, and that gesture facilitates the former process.

Functional MRI was used to observe focal changes in blood flow in the brains of 10 healthy volunteers performing a mental rotation task. On each trial, subjects viewed a pair of perspective drawings of three-dimensional shapes, mentally rotated one into congruence with the other, and then determined whether the two forms were identical or mirror-images. The control task, which we have called the \u2018comparison\u2019 condition, was identical except that both members of each pair appeared at the same orientation, and hence the same encoding, comparison and decision processes were used but mental rotation was not required. These tasks were interleaved with a baseline \u2018fixation\u2019 condition, in which the subjects viewed a crosshair. Technically adequate studies were obtained in eight of the 10 subjects. Areas of increased signal were identified according to sulcal landmarks and are described in terms of the Brodmann's area (BA) definitions that correspond according to the atlas of Talaraich and Tournoux. When the rotation task was contrasted with the comparison condition, all subjects showed consistent foci of activation in BAs 7a and 7b (sometimes spreading to BA 40); 88% had increased signal in middle frontal gyrus (BA 8) and 75% showed extrastriate activation, including particularly BAs 39 and 19, in a position consistent with area V5/human MT as localized by functional and histological assays. In more than half of the subjects, hand somatosensory cortex (3-1-2) was engaged, and in 50% of subjects there was elevated signal in BA 18. In frontal cortex, activation was above threshold in half the subjects in BAs 9 and/or 46 (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Some (four out of eight) subjects also showed signal increases in BAs 44 and/or 46. Premotor cortex (BA 6) was active in half of the subjects during the rotation task. There was little evidence for lateralization of the cortical activity or of engagement of motor cortex.

Spatial scenes are most often described from the perspective of the person signing (the `narrator'), such that the viewer must perform what amounts to a 180\u00b0 mental rotation to correctly comprehend the description. But scenes can also be described, non-canonically, from the viewer's perspective, in which case no rotation is required. Is mental rotation during sign language processing difficult for ASL signers? Are there differences between linguistic and non-linguistic mental rotation? Experiment 1 required subjects to decide whether a signed description matched a room presented on videotape. Deaf ASL signers were more accurate when viewing scenes described from the narrator's perspective (even though rotation is required) than from the viewer's perspective (no rotation required). In Experiment 2, deaf signers and hearing non-signers viewed videotapes of objects appearing briefly and sequentially on a board marked with an entrance. This board either matched an identical board in front of the subject or was rotated 180\u00b0. Subjects were asked to place objects on their board in the orientation and location shown on the video, making the appropriate rotation when required. All subjects were significantly less accurate when rotation was required, but ASL signers performed significantly better than hearing non-signers under rotation. ASL signers were also more accurate in remembering object orientation. Signers then viewed a video in which the same scenes were signed from the two perspectives (i.e. rotation required or no rotation required). In contrast to their performance with real objects, signers did not show the typical mental rotation effect. Males outperformed females on the rotation task with objects, but the superiority disappeared in the linguistic condition. We discuss the nature of the ASL mental rotation transformation, and we conclude that habitual use of ASL can enhance non-linguistic cognitive processes thus providing evidence for (a form of) the linguistic relativity hypothesis.", "source": ["UCBL", "Istex"], "host": {"title": "Cognition"}, "publicationDate": "1998", "authors": [{"name": "Karen Emmorey"}, {"name": "Edward Klima"}, {"name": "Gregory Hickok"}], "KeyWords": ["American Sign Language", "Mental rotation", "Linguistic relativity"]},

The two experiments reported here are based on the idea of making the discriminative response sufficiently difficult so as to force the rotation of complete images. The first one scaled the similarity between standard polygons and certain systematically mutated versions. From the ratings so obtained, two levels of perceived similarity, high and low, were defined and served as separate conditions in a response-time, image rotation experiment. The second experiment tested the complexity hypothesis by examining the effect of similarity on rotation rates and its interaction with levels of complexity.

The algorithm exhibits computation times which increase linearly with the angle of rotation. Shepard found a similar linear function in his experiments with human subjects. In addition, the intermediate states of the computation are such that if the rotation process were to be interrupted at any point, the object representation would correspond to that of the actual object at a position along the rotation trajectory. The computational model presented here is governed by three constraining assumptions: (a) that it be parallel: (b) that the communication between processors be restricted to immediate neighbors: (c) that the object representation be distributed across a large fraction of the available processors.

Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the representation of the hand in left primary motor cortex while participants performed mental rotation of pictures of hands and feet. Relative to a peripheral magnetic stimulation control condition, response times (RTs) were slower when TMS was delivered at 650 ms but not at 400 ms after stimulus onset. The magnetic stimulation effect at 650 ms was larger for hands than for feet. These findings demonstrate that (i) activation of the left primary motor cortex has a causal role in the mental rotation of pictures of hands; (ii) this role is stimulus-specific because disruption of neural activity in the hand area slowed RTs for pictures of hands more than feet; and (iii) left primary motor cortex is involved relatively late in the mental rotation process.", "source": ["UCBL", "Istex"], "host": {"title": "Cerebral Cortex"}, "publicationDate": "2000", "authors": [{"name": "Giorgio Ganis"}, {"name": "Julian P.

Twenty-four right-handed volunteers (13 males and 11 females) were instructed to judge the handedness of a hand drawing in palm view by pressing a left/right key.

The results showed an effect of rotation angle (F(3, 69) = 19.57, P < 0.001), but not of hand identity, on MRTs. Moreover, for all hand drawings, a medial rotation elicited shorter MRTs than a lateral rotation (960 and 1169 ms, respectively, P < 0.05).

Other athletes, such as handball and soccer players, whose activities do require body rotations may have more experience with in-depth rotations. The present study examined the effect of two components that are differently solicited in sport practices on the mental rotation ability: the rotation axis (in-plane, in-depth) and the predominantly used limb (arms, legs). Handball players, soccer players, and gymnasts were asked to rotate handball and soccer strike images mentally, which were presented in different in-plane and in-depth orientations. The results revealed that handball and soccer players performed the in-depth rotations faster than in-plane rotations; however, the two rotation axes did not differ in gymnasts. In addition, soccer players performed the mental rotations of handball strike images slower.

N = 40 male gymnasts with either clockwise or anticlockwise rotation preference in a forward twisting layout salto performed a psychometric mental rotation test with either rotation-preference congruent or rotation-preference incongruent stimuli. Results revealed that choice reaction times differed clearly as a function of Angular Rotation between the stimuli figures. Gymnasts who preferred a clockwise rotation preference showed faster choice reaction times when the rotation direction of the reference figure was clockwise, and vice versa. The results clearly support the notion, that mental rotation performance varies as a function of sensory-motor system characteristics between different people. It is concluded, that sensory-motor experience in a particular sport may facilitate cognitive processing of experience-congruent stimuli. This may be advantageous for situations in which people are engaged in observing sport performance (i.e., judges, coaches).

Results showed a benefit of motor expertise and representations of another person's body, but only for the object-based transformation task.

The effect of figural complexity was greater for 90\u00b0 rotation than for 0\u00b0 in multiple regions, including the ventral, dorsal, and prefrontal regions. In addition, functional connectivity analyses on the correlations across the time courses of activation between regions of interest showed increased synchronization among multiple brain areas as task demand increased. The results indicate that both the dorsal and the ventral pathways show interactive effects of object and spatial processing, and they suggest that multiple regions interact to perform mental rotation.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "5", "title": "Cognitive Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience", "corpusName": "Psychonomic Society"}, "publicationDate": "2005", "authors": [{"name": "Hideya KOSHINO"}, {"name": "Patricia A.

The first experimental group trained in an interaction-enabled condition, the second experimental group trained in an animation-enhanced condition and the control group trained using printed materials. The research instruments used were computerized versions of the Mental Rotation and Spatial Visualization tests. Data were analyzed using a Statistical Package for Social Science, SPSS version 14.0. The results reveal a significant performance gain in spatial visualization and mental rotation accuracy, but not in mental rotation speed. The training method seems to be interlinked with SV, as the interaction-enabled group outperformed the other groups. In addition, technology based training methods seem more efficient, as both experimental groups performed better than the control group in MR accuracy. Moreover, gender was a significant variable, with boys attaining differential improvement gains, as opposed to girls. The group gaining higher SV through training performed better in solving an Orthographic Drawing task, indicating that the training method is related to the application of the received mental processes, in solving the task.

Right-left identification, where right and left terms are used, was harder even for the oldest subjects when associated with mental rotation. When children had to identify which image a person would see from another viewpoint, they succeeded when the person was looking away in the same direction as they were looking. When the person was facing the children (in the opposite direction or ''forward''), three different behaviours emerged which indicated absence or presence of mental rotation in perspective-taking.

The polygonal stimuli were presented in either spatially unfiltered, high-pass or low-pass filtered versions. All stimulus conditions produced mental rotation-type effects but with graded curvilinear trends. Women rotated faster than men under all conditions, an infrequent outcome in mental rotation studies. Overall, women yielded more convexly curvilinear response functions than men. For both sexes the curvilinearity was more pronounced under the non-mirror-different, low-pass stimulus condition than under the mirror different, high-pass stimulus condition. The results are considered as supporting the occurrence of two different mental rotation strategies and as suggesting that the women were predisposed to use efficiently an analytic feature rotation strategy, while the men were predisposed to employ efficiently a holistic pattern rotation strategy. It is argued that the overall design of this experiment promoted the application of an analytic strategy and thus conferred an advantage to the female participants.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "103", "title": "Perceptual and Motor Skills", "corpusName": ""}, "publicationDate": "2006", "authors": [{"name": "SYL VIA RAABE"}, {"name": "RAIN ER HOGER"}, {"name": "JUAN D.

In two experiments we provide support for an integrated explanation of practice effects in mental rotation by combining behavioural and EEG measures in a way that provides more rigorous inference than is available from either measure alone. Before practice participants displayed two well-established signatures of mental rotation: both response time and EEG negativity increased linearly with rotation angle. After extensive practice with a small set of stimuli, both signatures of mental rotation had all but disappeared. In contrast, after the same amount of practice with a much larger set both signatures remained, even though performance improved markedly. Taken together these results constitute a reversed association, which cannot arise from variation in a single cause, and so they provide compelling evidence for the existence of two routes to expertise in mental rotation.

Since explicit motor imagery is known to activate the sensorimotor areas of the cortex, mental rotation is expected to do similar if it involves a form of motor imagery. So far, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have been used to study mental rotation and less attention has been paid to an established method for studying explicit motor imagery. Although hand mental rotation is claimed to involve motor imagery, the time-frequency characteristics of mental rotation have never been compared with those of explicit motor imagery. In this study, time-frequency responses of EEG recorded during explicit motor imagery and during a mental rotation task, inducing implicit motor imagery, were compared. Fifteen right-handed healthy volunteers performed motor imagery of hands in one condition and hand laterality judgement tasks in another while EEG of the whole head was recorded. The hand laterality judgement was the mental rotation task used to induce implicit motor imagery. The time-frequency analysis and sLORETA localisation of the EEG showed that the activities in the sensorimotor areas had similar spatial and time-frequency characteristics in explicit motor imagery and implicit motor imagery conditions. Furthermore this sensorimotor activity was different for the left and for the right hand in both explicit and implicit motor imagery.

To determine if the MRM can be extrapolated to perceptually familiar angles (e.g., 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) within a range of equally spaced angles, we evaluated two independent sets of angles: 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 35\u00b0, 70\u00b0, 105\u00b0, and 140\u00b0 (experiment one) and 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 150\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 210\u00b0 (experiment two).

Further, structural equation modeling results supported the prediction that, whereas they all implicate some degree of visuospatial storage, the 3 spatial ability factors differ in the degree of executive involvement (highest for Spatial Visualization and lowest for Perceptual Speed).

That there are such powerful and pervasive influences of language on thought is the thesis of the Whorf\u2013Sapir linguistic relativity hypothesis which, after a lengthy period in intellectual limbo, has recently returned to prominence in the anthropological, linguistic, and psycholinguistic literatures. Our point of departure is an influential group of cross-linguistic studies that appear to show that spatial reasoning is strongly affected by the spatial lexicon in everyday use in a community (e.g. Brown, P., & Levinson, S. C. (1993). Linguistic and nonlinguistic coding of spatial arrays: explorations in Mayan cognition (Working Paper No. 24). Nijmegen: Cognitive Anthropology Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics; Cognitive Linguistics 6 (1995) 33). Specifically, certain groups customarily use an externally referenced spatial-coordinate system to refer to nearby directions and positions (\u201cto the north\u201d) whereas English speakers usually employ a viewer-perspective system (\u201cto the left\u201d). Prior findings and interpretations have been to the effect that users of these two types of spatial system solve rotation problems in different ways, reasoning strategies imposed by habitual use of the language-particular lexicons themselves. The present studies reproduce these different problem-solving strategies in speakers of a single language (English) by manipulating landmark cues, suggesting that language itself may not be the key causal factor in choice of spatial perspective. Prior evidence on rotation problem solution from infants (e.g. Acredolo, L.P. (1979). Laboratory versus home: the effect of environment on the 9-month-old infant\u2019s choice of spatial reference system. Developmental Psychology, 15 (6), 666\u2013667) and from laboratory animals (e.g. Restle, F. (1975). Discrimination of cues in mazes: a resolution of the place-vs.-response question. Psychological Review, 64, 217\u2013228) suggests a unified interpretation of the findings: creatures approach spatial problems differently depending on the availability and suitability of local landmark cues.

Its Content, Timing and Neuronal Source", "abstract": "What is rotated in mental rotation? The implicitly or explicitly most widely accepted assumption is that the rotated representation is a visual mental image. We here provide converging evidence that instead mental rotation is a process specialized on a certain type of spatial information. As a basis, we here develop a general theory on how to manipulate and empirically examine representational content. One technique to examine the content of the representation in mental rotation is to measure the influence of stimulus characteristics on rotational speed. Experiment 1a and 1b show that the rotational speed of university students (10 men, 10 women and 10 men, 11 women, respectively) is influenced exclusively by the amount of represented orientation-dependent spatial-relational information but not by orientation-independent spatial-relational information, visual complexity, or the number of stimulus parts. Obviously, only explicit orientation-dependent spatial-relational information in an abstract, nonvisual form is rotated. As information in mental-rotation tasks is initially presented visually, a nonvisual representation during rotation implies that at some point during processing information is recoded. Experiment 2 provides more direct evidence for this recoding. While university students (12 men, 12 women) performed our mental-rotation task, we recorded their EEG in order to extract slow potentials, which are sensitive to working-memory load. During initial stimulus processing, slow potentials were sensitive to the amount of orientation-independent information or to the visual complexity of the stimuli. During rotation, in contrast, slow potentials were sensitive to the amount of orientation-dependent information only. This change in slow potential behavior constitutes evidence for the hypothesized recoding of the content of the mental representation from a visual into a nonvisual form. We further assumed that, in order to be accessible for the process of mental rotation, orientation-dependent information must be represented in those brain areas that are also responsible for mental rotation proper. Indeed, in an fMRI study on university students (12 men, 12 women) the very same set of brain areas was specifically activated by both the amount of mental rotation and of orientation-dependent information. The amount of orientation-independent information/visual complexity, in contrast, influenced activation in a different set of brain areas. Together, all activated areas constitute the so-called mental rotation network. In sum, the present work provides a general theory and several techniques to examine mental representations and employs these techniques to identify the content, timing, and neuronal source of the mental representation in mental rotation.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "0", "title": "University thesis", "corpusName": "thesis"}, "publicationDate": "2012", "authors": [{"name": "Heinrich Ren\u00e9 Liesefeld"}], "KeyWords": ["mental rortation", "mental representation", "timing", "neuronal source"]},

Because the disembodied perspective during OBEs is elevated in the majority of cases, we tested whether an elevated perspective will interfere with such temporoparietal mechanisms mental own body imagery. We designed stimuli of life-sized humans rotated around the vertical axis and rendered as if viewed from three different perspectives: elevated, lowered, and normal. Reaction times (RTs) in an own body transformation task, but not the control condition, were dependent on the rotation angle. Furthermore, RTs were shorter for the elevated as compared with the normal or lowered perspective.

Subjects and methods: Seventeen female subjects with a regular menstrual cycle took part in the study. For assesssments of masculinity and femininity, the subjects filled the Bem's Sex Roles Inventory.

Several experiments have shown that playing action games induces changes in a number of sensory, perceptual, and attentional abilities that are important for many tasks in spatial cognition. These basic capacities include contrast sensitivity, spatial resolution, the attentional visual field, enumeration, multiple object tracking, and visuomotor coordination and speed. In addition to altering performance on basic tasks, playing action video games has a beneficial effect on more complex spatial tasks such as mental rotation, thus demonstrating that learning generalizes far beyond the training activities in the game.

Marr and Nishihara (1978) proposed that shapes are represented in memory as structural descriptions in object-centered coordinate systems, so that an object is represented identically regardless of its orientation. An alternative hypothesis is that an object is represented in memory in a single representation corresponding to a canonical orientation, and a mental rotation operation transforms an input shape into that orientation before input and memory are compared. A third possibility is that shapes are stored in a set of representations, each corresponding to a different orientation. In four experiments, subjects studied several objects each at a single orientation, and were given extensive practice at naming them quickly, or at classifying them as normal or mirror-reversed, at several orientations. At first, response times increased with departure from the study orientation, with a slope similar to those obtained in classic mental rotation experiments. This suggests that subjects made both judgments by mentally transforming the orientation of the input shape to the one they had initially studied. With practice, subjects recognized the objects almost equally quickly at all the familiar orientations. At that point they were probed with the same objects appearing at novel orientations. Response times for these probes increased with increasing disparity from the previously trained orientations. This indicates that subjects had stored representations of the shapes at each of the practice orientations and recognized shapes at the new orientations by rotating them to one of the stored orientations. The results are consistent with a hybrid of the second (mental transformation) and third (multiple view) hypotheses of shape recognition: input shapes are transformed to a stored view, either the one at the nearest orientation or one at a canonical orientation. Interestingly, when mirror-images of trained shapes were presented for naming, subjects took the same time at all orientations. This suggests that mental transformations of orientation can take the shortest path of rotation that will align an input shape and its memorized counterpart, in this case a rotation in depth about an axis in the picture plane.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "21", "title": "Cognitive Psychology", "corpusName": "Elsevier"}, "publicationDate": "1989", "authors": [{"name": "Michael J.

However, it is unknown whether trait anxiety affects the processing of information obtained through externalized representations such as maps. Here, we addressed this question by taking into account emerging evidence indicating impaired performance in executive tasks by high trait anxiety specifically in individuals with lower executive capacities. For this purpose, we tested 104 male participants, previously characterised on trait anxiety and mental rotation ability, on a newly-designed map-based route learning task, where participants matched routes presented dynamically on a city map to one presented immediately before (same/different judgments). We predicted an interaction between trait anxiety and mental rotation ability, specifically that performance in the route learning task would be negatively affected by anxiety in participants with low mental rotation ability. Importantly, and as predicted, an interaction between anxiety and mental rotation ability was observed: trait anxiety negatively affected participants with low\u2014but not high\u2014mental rotation ability.

An alternative hypothesis emphasizes the importance of bodily processes in cognition: the representation of a concept appears to be crucially dependent upon perceptual-motor processes that relate to it. Thus, understanding action-related words would rely upon the same motor structures that also support the execution of the same actions. In this context, motor simulation represents a key component. Our approach is to draw parallels between the literature on mental rotation and the literature on action verb/sentence processing. Here we will discuss recent studies on mental imagery, mental rotation, and language that clearly demonstrate how motor simulation is neither automatic nor necessary to language understanding. These studies have shown that motor representations can or cannot be activated depending on the type of strategy the participants adopt to perform tasks involving motor phrases. On the one hand, participants may imagine the movement with the body parts used to carry out the actions described by the verbs (i.e., motor strategy); on the other, individuals may solve the task without simulating the corresponding movements (i.e., visual strategy). While it is not surprising that the motor strategy is at work when participants process action-related verbs, it is however striking that sensorimotor activation has been reported also for imageable concrete words with no motor content, for \u201cnon-words\u201d with regular phonology, for pseudo-verb stimuli, and also for negations. Based on the extant literature, we will argue that implicit motor imagery is not uniquely used when a body-related stimulus is encountered, and that it is not the type of stimulus that automatically triggers the motor simulation but the type of strategy. Finally, we will also comment on the view that sensorimotor activations are subjected to a top-down modulation.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "4", "title": "Hypothesis and theory article", "corpusName": "Frontiers in Psychology"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Barbara Tomasino"}, {"name": "Raffaella Ida Rumiati"}], "KeyWords": ["motor simulation", "word representations", "action understanding", "imagery", "cognitive strategies"]},

Six subjects participated in an fMRI experiment while presented with both conditions in alternating blocks.

Our prediction was that people in the ''dizzy'' group would take longer at a left/right neck rotation judgment task but not a left/right hand judgment task, because actually performing the former, but not the latter, would exacerbate their dizziness. Secondly, we predicted that when dizzy participants responded to neck rotation images, responses would be greatest when images were in the upside down orientation; an orientation with greatest dizzy-provoking potential. To test this idea, we used a case-control comparison design. One hundred and eighteen participants who suffered from dizziness and 118 age, gender, arm pain, and neck pain-matched controls took part in the study. Participants undertook two motor imagery tasks; a left/right neck rotation judgment task and a left/right hand judgment task.

We directly test the hypothesis by means of a dual-task paradigm in which subjects perform the Cooper\u2013Shepard mental rotation task while executing an unseen motor rotation in a given direction and at a previously-learned speed. Four results support the inference that mental rotation relies on motor processes. First, motor rotation that is compatible with mental rotation results in faster times and fewer errors in the imagery task than when the two rotations are incompatible. Second, the angle through which subjects rotate their mental images, and the angle through which they rotate a joystick handle are correlated, but only if the directions of the two rotations are compatible. Third, motor rotation modifies the classical inverted V-shaped mental rotation response time function, favoring the direction of the motor rotation; indeed, in some cases motor rotation even shifts the location of the minimum of this curve in the direction of the motor rotation. Fourth, the preceding effect is sensitive not only to the direction of the motor rotation, but also to the motor speed.

In each trial, participants decided whether 2 rotated letters, presented either in the same visual field (within-field trials) or in opposite visual fields (across-field trials), were both of normal orientation, or whether one was normal and the other was mirror-reversed. To discriminate a letter's orientation, one must rotate the letter to the upright position. Therefore, we manipulated whether the two letters imposed similar or dissimilar demands on cognitive resources by varying the number of degrees that each letter needed to be rotated to reach the upright position. As predicted, in 2 experiments we found that the across-field advantage increased as the number of degrees each letter needed to be rotated became more dissimilar. These findings support a current model of hemispheric interactions, which posits that an unequal hemispheric distribution of cognitive load allows the cerebral hemispheres to take the lead for different aspects of cognitive processing.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "21", "title": "Neuropsychology", "corpusName": "American Psychological Association"}, "publicationDate": "2007", "authors": [{"name": "Kazuhito Yoshizaki"}, {"name": "Daniel H.

Reaction time to discriminate version increased linearly with orientation for both children and adults, but reaction time to identify was not strongly influenced by orientation for either children or adults.

Two central questions about mental rotation remain: Does mental rotation depend on analog spatial representations, and does mental rotation depend on motor simulation? A review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies help answer these questions. Mental rotation is accompanied by increased activity in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent regions. These areas contain spatially mapped representations, and activity in these areas is modulated by parametric manipulations of mental rotation tasks, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations. Mental rotation also is accompanied by activity in the medial superior precentral cortex, particularly under conditions that favor motor simulation, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on motor simulation in some situations. The relationship between mental rotation and motor simulation can be understood in terms of how these two processes update spatial reference frames.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "20", "title": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "corpusName": "MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts,USA"}, "publicationDate": "2008", "authors": [{"name": "Jeffrey M.

Two tasks were designed to selectively elicit these two transformations using the same materials, participants, and task parameters: one required same-different judgments about pairs of pictures, while the other required left-right judgments about single pictures. For pictures of human bodies, the two tasks showed strikingly different patterns of response time as a function of stimulus orientation. Moreover, across individuals, the two tasks had different relationships to psychometric tests of spatial ability. The chronometric and individual difference data converge with neuropsychological and neuroimaging data in suggesting that different mental spatial transformations are performed by dissociable neural systems.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "2", "title": "Spatial Cognition and Computation", "corpusName": "Springer"}, "publicationDate": "2002", "authors": [{"name": "Jeffrey M.

Such sex differences have been suggested to bear implications on our understanding of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, it is still debated how the sex difference in MR performance relates to differences between individuals with ASD compared to typically developed control persons (TD). To provide a detailed exploration of sex differences in MR performance, we studied rotational (indicated by slopes) and non-rotational aspects (indicated by intercepts) of the MR task in TD individuals (total N = 50). Second-to-fourth digit length ratios (2D:4D) were measured to investigate the associations between prenatal testosterone and performance on MR tasks. Handedness was assessed by the use of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory in order to examine the relation between handedness and MR performance. In addition, we investigated the relation of spatial to systemising abilities, both of which have been associated with sex differences and with ASD, employing the Intuitive Physics Test (IPT). Results showed a male advantage in rotational aspects of the MR task, which correlated with IPT results. These findings are in contrast to the MR performance of individuals with ASD who have been shown to outperform TD persons in the non-rotational aspects of the MR task. These results suggest that the differences in MR performance due to ASD are different from sex-related differences in TD persons, in other words, ASD is not a simple and continuous extension of the male cognitive profile into the psychopathological range as the extreme male brain hypothesis (EMB) of ASD would suggest.", "source": ["UCBL"], "host": {"volume": "", "title": "PlosOne research article", "corpusName": "PLOS ONE"}, "publicationDate": "2015", "authors": [{"name": "Alexandra C.
