We describe and classify the current state of diagnostic HIT and identify future research directions. Methods A multi-pronged literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, backwards and forwards reference searches and contributions from domain experts. We included HIT systems evaluated in clinical and experimental settings as well as previous reviews, and excluded radiology computer-aided diagnosis, monitor alerts and alarms, and studies focused on disease staging and prognosis. Articles were organised within a conceptual framework of the diagnostic process and areas requiring further investigation were identified. Results HIT approaches, tools and algorithms were identified and organised into 10 categories related to those assisting: (1) information gathering; (2) information organisation and display; (3) differential diagnosis generation; (4) weighing of diagnoses; (5) generation of diagnostic plan; (6) access to diagnostic reference information; (7) facilitating follow-up; (8) screening for early detection in asymptomatic patients; (9) collaborative diagnosis; and (10) facilitating diagnostic feedback to clinicians. We found many studies characterising potential interventions, but relatively few evaluating the interventions in actual clinical settings and even fewer demonstrating clinical impact.

The effects are increasingly seen among younger people who binge drink. The effects of excess alcohol on the skeleton have attracted far less attention than those on other organs, but the risk of fractures at important sites, such as the hips and vertebrae, is greatly increased in alcoholics. This is partly owing to reductions in bone mineral density, but other factors such as an increased rate of falls play an important part. The contribution of excess alcohol consumption to the risk of fractures is recognised in the widely available fracture assessment tool (FRAX). The mechanisms of fracture in alcohol abusers are complex and involve direct effects on bone cells, and indirect effects, mediated by alcohol, on the endocrine system, pancreas and cytokine system. Poor nutrition, with a reduction in body mass index and vitamin D levels, often contributes significantly. Prevention and treatment of fractures in alcohol abusers has received limited attention, and there are surprisingly few therapeutic trials to guide clinical intervention. Abstinence has been shown to improve markers of bone turnover within 2\u2005months. However, compliance with oral therapeutic agents is often poor, and bisphosphonates may be contraindicated in patients with alcoholic liver disease and varices.

Once identified, mutation carriers can be recommended for intensive screening that will substantially reduce their high colorectal cancer risk. Conversely, the relatives of carriers identified as non-carriers can be relieved of the burden of intensive screening. Criteria and prediction models that identify likely mutation carriers are needed for cost-effective, targeted, germline testing for MMR gene mutation. We reviewed 12 criteria/guidelines and 8 prediction models (Leiden, Amsterdam-plus, Amsterdam-alternative, MMRpro, PREMM1,2,6, MMRpredict, Associazione Italiana per lo studio della Familiarit\u00e0 ed Ereditariet\u00e0 dei tumori Gastrointestinali (AIFEG) and the Myriad Genetics Prevalence table) for identifying mutation carriers. While criteria are only used to identify individuals with colorectal cancer (yes/no for screening followed by germline testing), all prediction models except MMRpredict and Myriad tables can predict the probability of carrying mutations for individuals with or without colorectal cancer. We conducted a meta-analysis of the discrimination performance of 17 studies that validated the prediction models. The pooled estimate for the area under curve was 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.88) for MMRpro, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88) for MMRpredict, 0.84 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.88) for PREMM, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) for Leiden model.

Overall, the existing statistical models have been shown to be sensitive and specific (at a 5% cut-off) in predicting MMR gene mutation carriers.

Aim To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for palliative interventions reducing health service costs without impacting on quality of care. Method An electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and CINAHL databases, augmented by hand-searching techniques, was performed. Only research where palliative care was the intervention or observation, and cost, together with either quality of life or patient satisfaction with care were outcome measures, was included in results. Results Of 1964 sources identified, only 12 measured both cost and an appropriate quality outcome. Evidence supported existing research that palliative care interventions generally reduce health service costs. Evidence of concurrent improvement in quality-of-life outcomes was limited; little available evidence derives from randomised trial designs. Small sample sizes and disparate outcome measures hamper statistical assessments. Conclusions Evidence that palliative interventions cut costs, without reducing quality of life, by minimising futile medical acts is limited.

This systematic review with meta-analysis utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for the search and reporting phases of the study. Der-Simonian and Laird random effects models were used to summarise sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), likelihood ratios and diagnostic OR. Results The employed search strategy revealed 25 potential articles, with 10 demonstrating high quality. Fourteen articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that most tests possess weak diagnostic properties with the exception of the patellar-pubic percussion test, which had excellent pooled SN 95 (95% CI 92 to 97%) and good specificity 86 (95% CI 78 to 92%). Conclusion Several studies have investigated pathology in the hip. Few of the current studies are of substantial quality to dictate clinical decision-making. Currently, only the patellar-pubic percussion test is supported by the data as a stand-alone HPE test. Further studies involving high quality designs are needed to fully assess the value of HPE tests for patients with intra- and extra-articular hip dysfunction.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "47", "title": "British Journal of Sports Medicine", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Michael P Reiman"}, {"name": "Adam P Goode"}, {"name": "Eric J Hegedus"}, {"name": "Chad E Cook"}, {"name": "Alexis A Wright"}], "KeyWords": ["Diagnostic", "accuracy", "clinical", "tests", "hip:", "systematic", "review", "meta-analysis"]},

Increasingly, SHSe assessment is an element of tobacco control research and implementation worldwide. In spite of decades of development of approaches to assess SHSe, there are still unresolved methodological issues; therefore, a multidisciplinary expert meeting was held to catalogue the approaches to assess SHSe and with the goal of providing a set of uniform methods for future use by investigators and thereby facilitate comparisons of findings across studies. The meeting, held at Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, was supported by the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI). A series of articles were developed to summarise what is known about self-reported, environmental and biological SHSe measurements. Non-smokers inhale toxicants in SHS, which are mainly products of combustion of organic materials and are not specific to tobacco smoke exposure. Biomarkers specific to SHSe are nicotine and its metabolites (eg, cotinine), and metabolites of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Cotinine is the preferred blood, saliva and urine biomarker for SHSe. Cotinine and nicotine can also be measured in hair and toenails. NNAL (4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanol), a metabolite of NNK, can be determined in the urine of SHS-exposed non-smokers. The selection of a particular biomarker of SHSe and the analytic biological medium depends on the scientific or public health question of interest, study design and setting, subjects, and funding.

Over the years it has been demonstrated that KIT/PDGFRA WT GISTs are profoundly different from mutant GIST in clinical and molecular profiles, so that they are now considered a separate pathological entity. Moreover, due to their extreme molecular and clinical heterogeneity, KIT/PDGFRA WT GIST should be considered as a family of diseases and not as a single disease entity. However, although several genetic alterations belonging only to KIT/PDGFRA WT GIST have been identified, the exact role of these molecules in the pathogenesis and development of this subgroup is not yet defined.

As yet there is no conclusive evidence that that gene doping has been practiced in sport. However, given that gene therapy techniques improve continuously, the likelihood of abuse will increase. A literature search was conducted to identify the most relevant proteins based on their current gene doping potential using articles from Pubmed, Scopus and Embase published between 2006 and 2011. The final list of selected proteins were erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, myostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, endorphin and enkephalin, \u03b1 actinin 3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR\u03b4) and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C).

Th17 cells are known to produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A as well as other effector cytokines, including IL-17F and IL-22. Recent research has demonstrated that IL-17A is also expressed by multiple lineages of the innate immune system, including mast cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, \u03b3\u03b4-T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. It can thus be expected that the inhibition of IL-17A as a therapeutic target in autoimmune disease would exert different physiological effects than the suppression of Th17 cell activity. Early clinical data are now available on secukinumab (AIN457), a recombinant, highly selective, fully human monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody of the IgG1/\u03ba isotype, enabling a preliminary assessment of the effects of IL-17A inhibition in multiple autoimmune diseases.

We searched Medline/PubMed for publications on acute decompensated heart failure and cardiomyopathy in Africa for the past 5\u2005years (ie, 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012). This was supplemented with personal communications with colleagues from Africa working in the field. A large prospective registry has shown that acute decompensated heart failure is caused by hypertension, cardiomyopathy and rheumatic heart disease in 90% of cases, a pattern that is in contrast with the dominance of coronary artery disease in North America and Europe. Furthermore, acute heart failure is a disease of the young with a mean age of 52\u2005years, occurs equally in men and women, and is associated with high mortality at 6\u2005months (\u223c18%), which is, however, similar to that observed in non-African heart failure registries, suggesting that heart failure has a dire prognosis globally, regardless of aetiology. The molecular genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in Africans is consistent with observations elsewhere in the world; the unique founder effects in the Afrikaner provide an opportunity for the study of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in large numbers of individuals with cardiomyopathy due to the same mutation.

This study aims to identify if arterial grafts are superior to saphenous vein (SV) grafts and whether graft failure rates vary between proximal and distal RCA anastomoses. Methods 29 studies identified by systematic review were analysed for study quality and length of follow-up using Bayesian hierarchical random effects modelling. Heterogeneity was assessed and sensitivity analysis performed. Primary endpoints were graft patency at early, mid and late-term follow-up when compared with SV grafts. Results There was no difference in early failure of radial artery (RA) or right gastroepiploic artery grafts when compared with SV (OR 0.82, 95% CI (0.14 to 2.68) and OR 1.19 (0.08 to 4.66), respectively). However, mid-term ORs based on observational study data demonstrated increased graft failure with right gastroepiploic artery and right internal thoracic artery compared with SV (OR 2.76 (1.26 to 5.48) and OR 2.07 (0.96 to 3.98), respectively), although right internal thoracic artery did not achieve statistical significance. No significant difference was observed in late graft failure for RA compared with SV (OR 0.47 (0.09 to 1.41)) without study-type disparity. However, simplified statistical pooling revealed significantly lower graft failure was observed with RA grafts to the proximal RCA when compared with SV (\u03c72 6.15, p=0.01).

Methods Potential studies were identified from electronic databases and trial registries and by scanning reference lists. Risk of bias and methodological quality were evaluated. Two independent reviewers screened, assessed studies and extracted data. Data were synthesised descriptively due to study heterogeneity. Results A total of 230 records were identified; 10 studies were included. Five studies conducted a full economic evaluation and five studies involved cost analyses. Lack of blinding was the main risk of bias. The methodological quality of the full economic evaluations was fairly good. Valuation of costs, measurement of outcomes and sensitivity analysis were points for improvement. Single studies showed that the Ottawa ankle rules (OAR) was cost effective for diagnosing lateral ankle sprains in the emergency setting compared with existing hospital protocols; acute treatment with anti-inflammatory medication and the plaster cast for severe sprains appeared cost effective; and neuromuscular training was cost effective in preventing ankle re-injury. Conclusions Results of this current systematic review supplements the evidence provided by reviews of effectiveness. There is evidence to support the implementation of OAR in the emergency setting, the use of anti-inflammatory medication and the plaster cast in the acute phase, and the prescription of neuromuscular exercises to prevent re-injury.

The health consequences of obesity on multiple body systems have been well established as has the financial cost of the condition to both the individuals affected as well as to society as a whole. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the only long term effective solution in terms of sustained weight loss and comorbidity resolution. The commonest bariatric procedure in the UK is the Roux-en-y gastric bypass which consistently results in the loss of 70%-80% of excess bodyweight. Results however are variable and in order to optimise resource allocation and avoid exposing patients unlikely to benefit from surgery to its inherent risks, much research has been done to try to identify those patients most likely to obtain a good result. The only factor which has been subjected to meta-analysis is that of preoperative weight loss which shows a positive association with postoperative weight loss following bypass surgery. Although the remaining data are not based on level 1 evidence those other preoperatively identifiable factors which are associated with an improved outcome include Caucasian or Hispanic ethnicity, higher educational status, non-shift-work working patterns, female gender and divorced or single marital status. Similarly increased levels of preoperative physical activity and an absence of binge eating behaviour are consistent with a favourable result whereas increased age, smoking and other socioeconomic factors have not been shown to have a significant impact.

As limited data on injury and illness risks exist in AR, knowledge and experiences had to be taken from other Paralympic sports.

AR has inherent injury and health risks especially within thorax, shoulders and low back region, but they are not expected to be significantly modified by increased racing times. Specific considerations need to be taken into account for athletes with a spinal cord injury, like in other sport disciplines.

Repair of injured skeletal muscle is an area that continues to present a challenge for sports medicine clinicians and researchers due, in part, to complete muscle recovery being compromised by development of fibrosis leading to loss of function and susceptibility to re-injury. Injured skeletal muscle goes through a series of coordinated and interrelated phases of healing including degeneration, inflammation, regeneration and fibrosis. Muscle regeneration initiated shortly after injury can be limited by fibrosis which affects the degree of recovery and predisposes the muscle to reinjury. It has been demonstrated in animal studies that antifibrotic agents that inactivate transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 have been effective at decreasing scar tissue formation. Several studies have also shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can increase the efficiency of skeletal muscle repair by increasing angiogenesis and, at the same time, reducing the accumulation of fibrosis. We have isolated and thoroughly characterised a population of skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) that enhance repair of damaged skeletal muscle fibres by directly differentiating into myofibres and secreting paracrine factors that promote tissue repair. Indeed, we have found that MDSCs transplanted into skeletal and cardiac muscles have been successful at repair probably because of their ability to secrete VEGF that works in a paracrine fashion. The application of these techniques to the study of sport-related muscle injuries awaits investigation. Other useful strategies to enhance skeletal muscle repair through increased vascularisation may include gene therapy, exercise, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and, potentially, massage therapy. Based on recent studies showing an accelerated recovery of muscle function from intense eccentric exercise through massage-based therapies, we believe that this treatment modality offers a practical and non-invasive form of therapy for skeletal muscle injuries. However, the biological mechanism(s) behind the beneficial effect of massage are still unclear and require further investigation using animal models and potentially randomised, human clinical studies.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "89", "title": "Postgraduate Medical Journal", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas M Best"}, {"name": "Burhan Gharaibeh"}, {"name": "Johnny Huard"}], "KeyWords": ["Republished:", "Stem", "cells,", "angiogenesis", "muscle", "healing:", "potential", "role", "massage", "therapies?"]},

The occurrence of sick leave in IA patients varied from 3.7% in the past 4\u2005days to 84% in the past 2.5\u2005years. Total duration of sick leave ranged from 0.1 to 11\u2005days over 1\u2005month. Pain and functional disability were associated with sick leave and workplace productivity loss. About 17%\u201388% of IA patients experienced workplace productivity loss, four studies investigated determinants. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with reduced workplace productivity loss and sick leave. Conclusions IA impacts worker productivity, but its estimated magnitude varies. Higher levels of sick leave and workplace productivity loss were reported for increased levels of pain and decreased levels of functional ability.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "72", "title": "Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Marie-Louise B Lenssinck"}, {"name": "Alex Burdorf"}, {"name": "Annelies Boonen"}, {"name": "Monique A Gignac"}, {"name": "Johanna M W Hazes"}, {"name": "Jolanda J Luime"}], "KeyWords": ["Consequences", "inflammatory", "arthritis", "workplace", "productivity", "loss", "sick", "leave:", "systematic", "review"]},

The aim of this review was to summarise the available evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of hydroxyurea in the management of SCD in children below 5\u2005years of age to support guideline development in Kenya. We undertook a systematic review and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system to appraise the quality of identified evidence. Overall, available evidence from 1 systematic review (n=26 studies), 2 randomised controlled trials (n=354 children), 14 observational studies and 2 National Institute of Health reports suggest that hydroxyurea may be associated with improved fetal haemoglobin levels, reduced rates of hospitalisation, reduced episodes of acute chest syndrome and decreased frequency of pain events in children with SCD. However, it is associated with adverse events (eg, neutropenia) when high to maximum tolerated doses are used. Evidence is lacking on whether hydroxyurea improves survival if given to young children. Majority of the included studies were of low quality and mainly from high-income countries.

By 2030, there will be 4 million cancer survivors in the UK. One quarter of cancer survivors are left with physical symptoms, which affect their quality of life. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most common of all chronic physical side-effects of cancer treatment and have the greatest impact on daily activity. Cancer therapies induce long-term changes in bowel function due to alterations to specific GI physiological functions. In addition, the psychological effect of a cancer diagnosis, new GI disease or pre-existing underlying conditions, may also contribute to new symptoms. Twenty-three upper GI symptoms have been identified as occurring after pelvic radiotherapy. After upper GI cancer treatment, the most troublesome symptoms include reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea and fatigue. Often, several symptoms are present simultaneously and women experience more symptoms than men. The symptoms which patients rate as most difficult are urgency, wind, diarrhoea, incontinence, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. Recent UK Guidance on managing GI symptoms suggests that these symptoms can be treated especially if gastroenterological advice is combined with dietetic and nursing input to optimise investigations and management. However, as different pathological processes can result in identical symptoms; a systematic, \u2018algorithmic\u2019 approach to assess and treat these symptoms is required.

Rather, the adolescent brain is likely to support the challenges specific to that period of life. New imaging techniques show striking changes in white and grey matter between 11 and 25\u2005years of age, with increased connectivity between brain regions, and increased dopaminergic activity in the pre-frontal cortices, striatum and limbic system and the pathways linking them. The brain is dynamic, with some areas developing faster and becoming more dominant until other areas catch up. Plausible mechanisms link these changes to cognitive and behavioural features of adolescence. The changing brain may lead to abrupt behavioural change with attendant risks, but such a brain is flexible and can respond quickly and imaginatively.

Methods Systematic review of all controlled studies and qualitative studies of women with a false-positive screening mammogram. The control group participants had normal mammograms. All psychological outcomes including returning for routine screening were permitted. All studies had a narrative synthesis. Results The searches returned seven includable studies (7/4423). Heterogeneity was such that meta-analysis was not possible. Studies using disease-specific measures found that, compared to normal results, there could be enduring psychological distress that lasted up to 3\u2005years; the level of distress was related to the degree of invasiveness of the assessment. At 3\u2005years the relative risks were, further mammography, 1.28 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.00), fine needle aspiration 1.80 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.77), biopsy 2.07 (95% CI 1.22 to 3.52) and early recall 1.82 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.72).

Methods A total 2090 children (aged 6\u201372\u2005months) completed detailed eye examinations in the Sydney Paediatric Eye Disease Study, including cycloplegic refraction, and were included. Refraction was measured using a Canon RK-F1 autorefractor, streak retinoscopy and/or the Retinomax K-Plus 2 autorefractor. Anisometropia was defined by the spherical equivalent (SE) difference, and plus cylinder difference for any cylindrical axis between eyes. Results The overall prevalence of SE and cylindrical anisometropia \u22651.0 D were 2.7% and 3.0%, for the overall sample and in children of European-Caucasian ethnicity, 3.2%, 1.9%; East-Asian 1.7%, 5.2%; South-Asian 2.5%, 3.6%; Middle-Eastern ethnicities 2.2%, 3.3%, respectively.

Risk (OR) of anisometropic amblyopia with \u22651.0 D of SE and cylindrical anisometropia was 12.4 (CI 4.0 to 38.4) and 6.5 (CI 2.3 to 18.7), respectively.

The advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has made it simpler to identify monogenic disease causes and could similarly simplify proving DI because one can simultaneously find mutations in two genes in the same sample. However, through 2012, I could find only one example of human DI in which HTS was used; in that example, HTS found only the second of the two genes. To explore the gap between expectation and reality, I tried to collect all examples of human DI with a narrow definition and characterise them according to the types of evidence collected, and whether there has been replication. Two strong trends are that knowledge of candidate genes and knowledge of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) have been helpful in most published examples of human DI. By contrast, the positional method of genetic linkage analysis, has been mostly unsuccessful in identifying genes underlying human DI.

The pulmonary cysts and repeated episodes of pneumothorax are the clinical hallmarks for discovering families affected by the syndrome. This disorder is caused by mutations in the gene coding for folliculin (FLCN). FLCN forms a complex with FLCN-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) and FNIP2 (also known as FNIPL), and the complex cross-talks with signalling molecules such as 5\u2032-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Heterozygous Flcn knockout mice and rats with Flcn gene mutations develop renal cysts, adenomas and/or carcinomas. These findings suggest that FLCN functions as a tumour suppressor that inhibits renal carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms of the formation of pulmonary cysts and pneumothorax associated with heterozygous mutations in FLCN are poorly understood. Resected lung specimens from patients with BHD are often misdiagnosed by pathologists as non-specific blebs or bullae or emphysema, and patients with BHD who have pulmonary cysts and repeated pneumothorax frequently do not receive appropriate medical investigations.

Methods 100 consecutive patients aged \u226540\u2005years (50 men and 50 women) who had undergone CT angiography (CTA) but had no vascular abnormality were analyzed. Specific software was used to make vessel measurements along the center line. The length of the intracranial vertebral artery (VA), the basilar artery (BA) and the distance from the mid-basilar artery to the posterior cerebral artery (mBA-PCA) was recorded.

In this review, we discuss the role of NDRG1 in cancer pathology. NDRG1 was observed to be downregulated in the majority of cancers. Moreover, the expression of NDRG1 was found to be significantly lower in neoplastic tissues as compared with normal tissues. The most important function of NDRG1 in inhibiting tumour progression is associated with its ability to suppress metastasis. However, it has also been shown to have important effects on other stages of cancer progression (primary tumour growth and angiogenesis). Recently, novel iron chelators with selective antitumour activity (ie, Dp44mT, DpC) were shown to upregulate NDRG1 in cancer cells. Moreover, Dp44mT showed its antimetastatic potential only in cells expressing NDRG1, making this protein an important therapeutic target for cancer chemotherapy.

Since acid plays a key role in GORD-associated mucosal lesions, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the dominant GORD treatment, being the most potent inhibitors of acid secretion available. However, the clinical effectiveness of PPIs varies with the specific symptoms being treated; they are more effective for heartburn than for regurgitation than for extra-oesophageal symptoms. An alternative therapeutic approach to GORD is to prevent the most fundamental cause of reflux symptoms, reflux itself, which most commonly occurs by transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation (TLOSR). Among potential pharmaceutical agents developed to target TLOSRs, the most advanced are GABAB (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) agonists, which experimentally reduce the occurrence of TLOSRs by about 40% in both animal and human studies. However, the effectiveness of GABAB agonists in clinical trials of patients with GORD with an incomplete response to PPI treatment has been modest. In part, this is probably attributable to the difficult problem of patient selection in these trials. Identifying patients by partial response to PPI treatment results in a heterogeneous population, including those with persistent weakly acidic reflux, patients with visceral hypersensitivity and those with functional heartburn, dyspepsia, or chest pain.

Patients admitted at weekends with AUGIB have increased mortality, and guidelines advise out-of-hours endoscopy. We present retrospective data from our service involving the interhospital transfer of patients. Design We pooled resources of two neighbouring general hospitals, just north of London. Emergency endoscopy is performed at the start of the list followed by elective endoscopy in the endoscopy unit on Saturday and Sunday mornings. From Friday evening to Sunday morning, patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth II Hospital (QEII) are medically stabilised and transferred to Lister Hospital by ambulance. Results 240 endoscopies were performed out of hours from December 2007 to March 2011. Of these, 54 patients were transferred: nine had emergency endoscopy at QEII as they were medically unstable; eight of the patients transferred required therapeutic intervention for active bleeding. The mean pre-endoscopy Rockall score of those transferred was 2.5. We examined the records of 51 of the 54 patients transferred. There were three deaths within 30\u2005days after endoscopy not associated with the transfer process. 19 (37%) patients had reduced hospitalisation after having their endoscopy at the weekend. Conclusions The introduction of the out-of-hours endoscopy service in our trust has had multiple benefits, including patients consistently receiving timely emergency endoscopy, significantly reduced disruption to emergency operating theatres, and participation of endoscopy nurses ensures a better and safer experience for patients, and better endoscopy decontamination.

Repair of injured skeletal muscle is an area that continues to present a challenge for sports medicine clinicians and researchers due, in part, to complete muscle recovery being compromised by development of fibrosis leading to loss of function and susceptibility to re-injury. Injured skeletal muscle goes through a series of coordinated and interrelated phases of healing including degeneration, inflammation, regeneration and fibrosis. Muscle regeneration initiated shortly after injury can be limited by fibrosis which affects the degree of recovery and predisposes the muscle to reinjury. It has been demonstrated in animal studies that antifibrotic agents that inactivate transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 have been effective at decreasing scar tissue formation. Several studies have also shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can increase the efficiency of skeletal muscle repair by increasing angiogenesis and, at the same time, reducing the accumulation of fibrosis. We have isolated and thoroughly characterised a population of skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) that enhance repair of damaged skeletal muscle fibres by directly differentiating into myofibres and secreting paracrine factors that promote tissue repair. Indeed, we have found that MDSCs transplanted into skeletal and cardiac muscles have been successful at repair probably because of their ability to secrete VEGF that works in a paracrine fashion. The application of these techniques to the study of sport-related muscle injuries awaits investigation. Other useful strategies to enhance skeletal muscle repair through increased vascularisation may include gene therapy, exercise, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and, potentially, massage therapy. Based on recent studies showing an accelerated recovery of muscle function from intense eccentric exercise through massage-based therapies, we believe that this treatment modality offers a practical and non-invasive form of therapy for skeletal muscle injuries.

The established surgical procedure of choice is colectomy with ileal pouch\u2013anal anastomosis (IPAA) for most patients. Patients with UC who have undergone IPAA are prone to develop inflammatory and non-inflammatory complications. Up to 50% of patients can be expected to experience at least one episode of pouchitis, and most of these patients will experience at least one additional acute episode within 2\u2005years. In other cases, pouchitis might follow a relapsing-remitting course or a chronically active course. The specific aetiology of pouchitis is unknown and the optimal means of diagnosis and classification of pouchitis is not completely agreed upon. Diagnosis of pouchitis based on symptoms alone has been shown to be non-specific due to the fact that symptoms can originate from a myriad of aetiologies, not necessarily inflammatory in nature. As a result, the diagnosis of pouchitis should generally be based on the appropriate constellation of symptoms, combined with endoscopic and histological assessment. Due to the frequently relapsing course of pouchitis, and the fact that the aetiology and pathogenesis are not entirely clear, the long-term management can sometimes be challenging.

Objective To summarise and critically review the current literature on genotype\u2013phenotype associations in patients with HCM and to perform a meta-analysis on selected clinical features. Data sources PubMed/Medline was searched up to January 2013. Retrieved articles were checked for additional publications. Selection criteria Observational, cross-sectional and prospectively designed English language human studies that analysed the relationship between the presence of mutations in sarcomeric protein genes and clinical parameters. Data extraction and analysis The pooled analysis was confined to studies reporting on cohorts of unrelated and consecutive patients in which at least two sarcomere genes were sequenced. A random effect meta-regression model was used to determine the overall prevalence of predefined clinical features: age at presentation, gender, family history of HCM, family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and maximum left ventricular wall thickness (MLVWT). The I2 statistic was used to estimate the proportion of total variability in the prevalence data attributable to the heterogeneity between studies. Results Eighteen publications (corresponding to a total of 2459 patients) were selected for the pooled analysis. The presence of any sarcomere gene mutation was associated with a younger age at presentation (38.4 vs 46.0\u2005years, p<0.0005), a family history of HCM (50.6% vs 23.1%, p<0.0005), a family history of SCD (27.0% vs 14.9%, p<0.0005) and greater MLVWT (21.0 vs 19.3\u2005mm, p=0.03). There were no differences when the two most frequently affected genes, MYBPC3 and MYH7, were compared. A total of 53 family studies were also included in the review. These were characterised by pronounced variability and the majority of studies reporting on outcomes analysed small cross-sectional cohorts and were unsuitable for pooled analyses. Conclusions The presence of a mutation in any sarcomere gene is associated with a number of clinical features. The heterogeneous nature of the disease and the inconsistency of study design precludes the establishment of more precise genotype\u2013phenotype relationships.

Field research shows that athletes can achieve outstanding EP while dehydrated > 2% bodyweight. Using the meta-analytic procedure, this study compared the findings of laboratory-based studies that examined the impact of EID upon EP using either ecologically valid (EV) (time-trial exercise) or non-ecologically valid (NEV) (clamped-intensity exercise) exercise protocols. Methods EP outcomes were put on the same scale and represent % changes in power output between euhydrated and dehydrated exercise tests. Random-effects model meta-regressions and weighted mean effect summaries, mixed-effects model analogue to the ANOVAs and magnitude-based effect statistics were used to delineate treatment effects. Main results Fifteen research articles were included, producing 28 effect estimates, representing 122 subjects. Compared with euhydration, EID increased (0.09\u00b12.60%, (p=0.9)) EP under time-trial exercise conditions, whereas it reduced it (1.91\u00b11.53%, (p<0.05)) with NEV exercise protocols. Only with NEV exercise protocols did EID \u2265 2% body weight impair EP (p=0.03). Conclusions Evidence indicates that (1) EID \u2264 4% bodyweight is very unlikely to impair EP under real-world exercise conditions (time-trial type exercise) and; (2) under situations of fixed-exercise intensity, which may have some relevance for military and occupational settings, EID \u2265 2% bodyweight is associated with a reduction in endurance capacity. The 2% bodyweight loss rule has been established from findings of studies using NEV exercise protocols and does not apply to out-of-doors exercise conditions.

Patients with ICCA have both BFIE and PKD and families with ICCA may contain individuals who exhibit all three phenotypes. These three phenotypes were all mapped by linkage analyses to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, and were hypothesised to have the same genetic basis due to the co-occurrence of the disorders in some families. Despite considerable effort, the gene or genes for BFIE, ICCA, and PKD were not identified for many years after the linkage region was identified. Mutations in the gene PRRT2 were identified in several Chinese families with PKD, suggesting that the gene may also be responsible for ICCA and BFIE in families linked to the chromosome 16 locus. This was demonstrated to be the case, with the majority of families with ICCA and BFIE found to have PRRT2 mutations. The vast majority of these mutations are truncating and are predicted to lead to haploinsufficiency. PRRT2 is a largely uncharacterised protein. It is expressed in the brain and has been demonstrated to interact with SNAP-25, a component of the molecular machinery involved in the release of neurotransmitters at the presynaptic membrane. Therefore, the PRRT2 protein may play a role in this process.

Because most chemotherapeutic agents do not effectively cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, it is widely accepted that radiation remains the primary modality of treatment. The mode by which radiation should be delivered has, however, become a source of intense controversy in recent years. The controversy involves whether patients with a limited number of brain metastases should undergo whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivered only to the radiographically visible tumours. Survival is comparable for patients treated with either modality. Instead, the controversy involves the neurocognitive function (NCF) of radiating cerebrum that appeared radiographically normal relative to effects of the growth from micro-metastatic foci. A fundamental question in this debate involves quantifying the effect of WBRT in patients with cerebral metastasis. To disentangle the effects of WBRT on neurocognition from the effects inherent to the underlying disease, we analysed the results from randomised controlled studies of prophylactic cranial irradiation in oncology patients as well as studies where patients with limited cerebral metastasis were randomised to SRS versus SRS+WBRT.

To date, there have been no published accounts demonstrating the effectiveness of checklists designed specifically for the unique demands of neurointerventional procedures. Methods A three-part, 20-item checklist was developed specific to neurointerventional procedures using the WHO surgical checklist as a template. Staff members (nurses, radiation technologists and physicians) were surveyed regarding near-miss adverse events and the quality of communication immediately following each neurointerventional procedure for 4\u2005weeks prior to implementation of the checklist and again for 4\u2005weeks after using the checklist. Staff members were asked to complete final surveys at the end of the study period. Results 71 procedures were performed during the 4\u2005weeks prior to checklist implementation and 60 procedures were performed during the 4\u2005weeks after institution of the checklist. Post-checklist surveys indicated significantly improved communication compared with pre-checklist surveys (\u03c72 29.4, p<0.001).

Design Systematic review. Data sources An electronic database search was conducted (to 6 August 2012) of databases such as: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Databases. References from identified articles were examined and seven authors of eligible studies were contacted for additional information. Study selection Studies of any design, without language restriction, were included; however, systematic reviews were excluded. Eligible studies included participants with a suspected ankle syndesmosis injury but without fracture. Reliability studies compared one or more clinical tests and studies of test accuracy compared the clinical test with a reference standard. Results The database search resulted in 114 full text articles which were assessed for eligibility. Three studies were included in the review and raw data of these studies were retrieved after contacting the authors. Eight clinical diagnostic tests were investigated; palpation of the tibiofibular ligaments, external rotation stress test, squeeze, Cotton, fibula translation, dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and anterior drawer tests. Two studies investigated diagnostic accuracy and both investigated the squeeze test by with conflicting results. Likelihood ratios (LR) ranging from LR+1.50 to LR\u22121.50 were found for other tests. High intra-rater reliability was found for the squeeze, Cotton, dorsiflexion ROM and external rotation tests (83\u2013100% close agreement).

Since 2003, the mainstay of risk stratification in the UK emergency departments has been a system of triage based on clinical assessment, which then dictates the need for a CT scan of the head. For patients with acute subdural or extradural haematomas, time from clinical deterioration to operation should be kept to a minimum, as it can affect their outcome. In addition, it is increasingly recognised that patients with severe and moderate TBI should be managed in neuroscience centres, regardless of the need for neurosurgical intervention. The monitoring and treatment of raised intracranial pressure is paramount for maintaining cerebral blood supply and oxygen delivery in patients with severe TBI.

Moreover, while active immunisation with A\u03b2 resulted in the clearance of A\u03b2, it did not prevent tau pathology or neurodegeneration. This prompts the concern that it might be too late to employ A\u03b2 targeting therapies once tau mediated neurodegeneration has occurred. Therefore, it is timely and very important to develop tau directed therapies. The pathomechanisms of tau mediated neurodegeneration are unclear but hyperphosphorylation, oligomerisation, fibrillisation and propagation of tau pathology have been proposed as the likely pathological processes that induce loss of function or gain of toxic function of tau, causing neurodegeneration.

Nine publications on eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two publications on two uncontrolled open-label trials and seven publications on three cohort studies were included. Temporary treatment with methotrexate (MTX), abatacept and intramuscular corticosteroids were demonstrated in RCTs with 12\u2005months to 5\u2005years follow-up to be more effective than placebo in suppressing disease activity or radiological progression. One study suggests that DMARD combination therapy is, at least after 4\u2005months, superior to MTX monotherapy in patients with UA at high risk of developing persistent arthritis. The open-label uncontrolled trials and cohort studies also suggested that early treatment may provide immediate suppression of inflammation. The long-term benefit of early treatment in UA remains unclear. In conclusion, patients with UA benefit from early treatment with MTX.

The life cycle of IEC is determined by the time span in which cells migrate from their place of origin at the crypt base to the villus tip, from where they are shed into the lumen. Cell death in the intestinal epithelium has to be tightly regulated and irregularities might cause pathologies. Excessive cell death has been associated with chronic inflammation as seen in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

An understanding of the concentration\u2013response relationship (pharmacodynamics) can be used to predict the target concentration required to achieve this target effect.

Quality control is also essential: internal and external controls should show appropriate staining. Immunohistochemistry must be interpreted in combination with the morphology seen on H&E sections. Myoepithelial markers, such as smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and p63, are useful for distinguishing invasive carcinoma from sclerosing lesions and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and in the classification of papillary lesions. Basal cytokeratins can help distinguish epithelial hyperplasia of usual type (UEH) and clonal proliferations such as DCIS and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). UEH usually shows patchy expression whereas DCIS and other clonal proliferations are typically negative. E-cadherin can usually separate DCIS and LCIS: DCIS typically shows membrane staining and most LCIS is negative. Cytokeratins can be used to detect small nodal metastases or subtle invasive carcinomas such as invasive lobular carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry plays a useful role in diagnosing spindle cell lesions such as a panel of cytokeratins to identify spindle cell carcinomas.

Other features of NMO include female preponderance, longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions (>3 vertebral segments), and absence of oligoclonal IgG bands . In spite of these differences from multiple sclerosis (MS), the relationship between NMO and MS has long been controversial. However, since the discovery of NMO-IgG or aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody (AQP4-antibody), an NMO-specific autoantibody to AQP4, the dominant water channel in the central nervous system densely expressed on end-feet of astrocytes, unique clinical features, MRI and other laboratory findings in NMO have been clarified further. AQP4-antibody is now the most important laboratory finding for the diagnosis of NMO. Apart from NMO, some patients with recurrent ON or recurrent longitudinally extensive myelitis alone are also often positive for AQP4-antibody. Moreover, studies of AQP4-antibody-positive patients have revealed that brain lesions are not uncommon in NMO, and some patterns appear to be unique to NMO. Thus, the spectrum of NMO is wider than mere ON and TM. Pathological analyses of autopsied cases strongly suggest that unlike MS, astrocytic damage is the primary pathology in NMO, and experimental studies confirm the pathogenicity of AQP4-antibody. Importantly, therapeutic outcomes of some immunological treatments are different between NMO and MS, making early differential diagnosis of these two disorders crucial.

This review examines eligible study findings that reported temporal (time of day, day of week and seasonal) patterns in ambulance demand. Methods Electronic searches of Medline and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature were conducted for papers published between 1980 and 2011. In addition, hand searching was conducted for unpublished government and ambulance service documents and reports for the same period. Results 38 studies examined temporal patterns in ambulance demand. Six studies reported trends in overall workload and 32 studies reported trends in a subset of ambulance demand, either as a specific case type or demographic group. Temporal patterns in overall demand were consistent between jurisdictions for time of day but varied for day of week and season. When analysed by case type, all jurisdictions reported similar time of day patterns, most jurisdictions had similar day of week patterns except for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and similar seasonal patterns, except for trauma. Temporal patterns in case types were influenced by age and gender. Conclusions Temporal patterns are present in ambulance demand and importantly these populations are distinct from those found in hospital datasets suggesting that variation in ambulance demand should not be inferred from hospital data alone.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. Results One review and 12 RCTs, all studying lateral epicondylitis, were included. Different therapeutic regimes were evaluated: stretching, strengthening, concentric/eccentric exercises and manipulation of the cervical or thoracic spine, elbow or wrist. No statistical pooling of the results could be performed owing to heterogeneity of the included studies. Therefore, a best-evidence synthesis was used to summarise the results. Moderate evidence for the short-term effectiveness was found in favour of stretching plus strengthening exercises versus ultrasound plus friction massage. Moderate evidence for short-term and mid-term effectiveness was found for the manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine as add-on therapy to concentric and eccentric stretching plus mobilisation of wrist and forearm.

They also help to identify priorities for public education. This paper presents a review and synthesis of published literature on public attitudes to death and dying in the UK from 1990. Method The approach to the review was systematic and involved searching for published research in five databases combined with reviewing references proposed by experts in the field and following up relevant citations from identified sources. The selected sources were assessed by the review team and analysed using a thematic approach. Results The review identified 22 sources reporting 19 studies which met our criteria for inclusion in the descriptive analysis.

To assess the need for and nature of smoking cessation services among physicians in China, a detailed literature review was conducted. Methods A literature review of studies published, in Chinese or in English, between 1987 and 2010, was carried out. The Medline, PubMed and Wanfang Data (a Chinese literature search database) electronic databases were searched for published studies. Results It was found that the overall current smoking prevalence among Chinese physicians ranged from 14% to 64% (men: 26% to 61%; women: 0% to 19%). There were significant gender differences in the smoking prevalence across studies with men smoking more than women. Though inconsistent, there were variations in smoking rates by professional posts and medical specialty. The quit smoking rates ranged from 5% to 14% across studies, with a higher rate among female physicians. Asking about smoking status or advising patients to quit smoking was not common practice among the physicians. Conclusions The results of this review suggest that while smoking habits of Chinese physicians vary among studies and across physicians in different specialties; prevalence rates tend to be higher than in physicians in the developed countries. Quitting rates were low among Chinese physicians, and the delivery of advice on quitting smoking was not common across the studies. Strategies to improve Chinese physicians' engagement in smoking cessation should address multiple factors including tobacco use and quitting practices among the physicians, their training needs and awareness of their professional responsibility with a healthcare system change approach.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "22", "title": "Tobacco Control", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Abu S Abdullah"}, {"name": "Feng Qiming"}, {"name": "Vivian Pun"}, {"name": "Frances A Stillman"}, {"name": "Jonathan M Samet"}], "KeyWords": ["review", "tobacco", "smoking", "smoking", "cessation", "practices", "among", "physicians", "China:", "1987\u20132010"]},

In 2011 the Medicare program paid $68 billion for physicians and other health professional services, 12% of total Medicare spending. Since 2002 the sustainable growth rate (SGR) correction has called for reductions to physician reimbursements; however, Congress has typically staved off these reductions, although the situation remains precarious for physicians who accept Medicare.

Knowledge of these patterns is essential for avoiding postoperative language deficits in epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Several predictors of atypical language representation exist. It is more prevalent in left-handed individuals.

Clinical observation suggests that reduced spontaneous and emotional facial expressions are features of facial bradykinesia in PD and atypical parkinsonism. In atypical parkinsonism, facial bradykinesia is complicated by additional dystonic features. Experimental studies evaluating spontaneous and emotional facial movements demonstrate that PD is characterised by a reduction in spontaneous blinking and emotional facial expression. In PD, neurophysiological studies show that voluntary orofacial movements are smaller in amplitude and slower in velocity. In contrast, movements of the upper face (eg, voluntary blinking) are normal in terms of velocity and amplitude but impaired in terms of switching between the closing and opening phases. In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), voluntary blinking is not only characterised by a severely impaired switching between the closing and opening phases of voluntary blinking, but is also slow in comparison with PD. In conclusion, in PD, facial bradykinesia reflects abnormalities of spontaneous, emotional and voluntary facial movements. In PSP, spontaneous and voluntary facial movements are abnormal but experimental studies on emotional facial movements are lacking. Data on facial bradykinesia in other atypical parkinsonism diseases, including multiple system atrophy and corticobasal degeneration, are limited. In PD, facial bradykinesia is primarily mediated by basal ganglia dysfunction whereas in PSP, facial bradykinesia is a consequence of a widespread degeneration involving the basal ganglia, cortical and brainstem structures.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "84", "title": "Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Matteo Bologna"}, {"name": "Giovanni Fabbrini"}, {"name": "Luca Marsili"}, {"name": "Giovanni Defazio"}, {"name": "Philip D Thompson"}, {"name": "Alfredo Berardelli"}], "KeyWords": ["Facial", "bradykinesia"]},

Results No new valid, conclusive evidence was provided to suggest the use of headgear in rugby, or mouth guards in American football, significantly reduced players\u2019 risk of concussion. No evidence was provided to suggest an association between neck strength increases and concussion risk reduction. There was evidence in ice hockey to suggest fair-play rules and eliminating body checking among 11-years-olds to 12-years-olds were effective injury prevention strategies. Evidence is lacking on the effects of legislation on concussion prevention. Equipment self-selection bias was a common limitation, as was the lack of measurement and control for potential confounding variables. Lastly, helmets need to be able to protect from impacts resulting in a head change in velocities of up to 10 and 7\u2005m/s in professional American and Australian football, respectively, as well as reduce head resultant linear and angular acceleration to below 50\u2005g and 1500\u2005rad/s2, respectively, to optimise their effectiveness.

These revised guidelines aim to optimise the quality and consistency of reporting of biopsies taken for the initial diagnosis of IBD by summarising the literature and making recommendations based on the available evidence. Advice from existing clinical guidelines is also taken into account. Among the subjects discussed are: distinguishing IBD from other colitides, particularly infective colitis; subclassification of IBD (as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or IBD unclassified); the discriminant value of granulomas; aspects of disease distribution, including discontinuity in ulcerative colitis; time-related changes; differences between paediatric and adult IBD; the role of ileal and upper gastrointestinal biopsies; differential diagnoses such as diverticular colitis and diversion proctocolitis; and dysplasia.

The main strategies under validation to bioengineer or regenerate liver, pancreas, or parts of the digestive tract are twofold: engineering of progenitor cells and seeding of cells on supporting scaffold material. In the first case, stem cells are initially expanded under standard tissue culture conditions. Thereafter, these cells may either be delivered directly to the tissue or organ of interest, or they may be loaded onto a synthetic or natural three-dimensional scaffold that is capable of enhancing cell viability and function. The new construct harbouring the cells usually undergoes a maturation phase within a bioreactor.

The specific nature of the scaffold within the bioreactor is critical for the development of this high-function phenotype.

Methods We reviewed our institution's medical records and performed a comprehensive literature search for cases of posterior circulation perforator aneurysms. Diagnostic imaging, management and clinical outcomes were the primary components of interest. Results Our first case was a 58-year-old patient who developed an infarct after attempted endovascular treatment of a basilar perforator artery aneurysm, the second case was a 55-year-old patient with a posterior cerebral artery perforator aneurysm who did well with conservative management and the third case was a 68-year-old patient who suffered an infarct after successful Onyx embolization of a superior cerebellar artery perforator aneurysm. From the literature we identified four case reports and four case series, all describing aneurysmal lesions of the basilar perforator arteries, giving a total of 17 cases including those from our institution. All cases presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage although 47% of initial vascular imaging studies failed to reveal the aneurysm.

Prevalence in the general population is 5-25% and it is twice as prevalent in women as in men. RLS is the most common movement disorder in pregnancy with a fourfold increased risk of developing this disorder later in life. The pathophysiology of RLS is centred on dopaminergic dysfunction, reduced central nervous system iron, genetic linkages, or alteration in neurotransmitters such as hypocretins, endorphins levels and immune dysfunction and inflammatory mechanisms. With the emergence of new evidence, there are changes to the previous treatment recommendations for RLS. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that dopamine agonists such as rotigotine transdermal patch, pramipexole, ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in the short-term treatment of RLS and rotigotine, followed by gabapentin enacarbil, ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin for long-term treatment. Based on expert consensus, the recommendation for daily RLS is dopamine agonists or gabapentin or low-potency opioids. Levodopa is less preferred for treating daily RLS due to its high risk of augmentation. For intermittent RLS, it is levodopa or dopamine agonists or low-potency opioids or benzodiazepines. For refractory RLS, the choice is to change to gabapentin or a different dopamine agonist, addition of a second agent like gabapentin or benzodiazepine to the existing drug or changing to a high-potency opioid or tramadol. Medications with safety record in pregnancy include opioids and antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and gabapentin.

After the remarkable decrease in polio cases from 198 in 2011 to only 58 in 2012, Pakistan seemed to be at the verge of success. However, hurdles continue to retard the campaign. The war against terrorism, misconceptions about polio vaccine, religious misinterpretations, frustration among vaccinators, lack of awareness, social considerations, natural calamities, inaccessibility, and inefficient vaccines and so on are continually rupturing the foundations of the worldwide initiative in the country.

Despite numerous studies reporting the results of ancillary marker investigations in PTs, the current histological grading systems remain unreliable at predicting clinical outcome even when supplemented by these markers. As a consequence, there has been much interest in the prospect of using molecular/genetic techniques to develop a more robust \u201cgrading\u201d system. This review focuses on recent cytogenetic and molecular studies investigating the pathogenesis of PTs and those correlating molecular findings with clinicopathological features of the tumours. Recent data highlight that intratumoural genetic heterogeneity is common in PTs and may account for the reported lack of correlation between histological grading and clinical behaviour. The entire spectrum of molecular aberrations in PTs are yet to be fully defined, however recent array-based studies using comparative genomic hybridisation have reported that copy number changes increase with the progression from benign PT to malignancy. Tumour recurrence and progression is likely to reflect the presence of under-recognised subclones. p16INK4a (CDKN2A) inactivation also appears to be important in PT pathogenesis.

We suggest that non-motor symptoms are based on the autoimmune disorders probably owing to an abnormal T cell repertoire from thymomas. Using previously reported cases and cases from our multicentre cooperative study, we review the clinical characteristics of patients with thymoma-associated MG who have non-motor symptoms. CD8 T cell cytotoxicity against haematopoietic precursor cells in bone marrow and unidentified autoantigens in hair follicles lead to the development of pure red cell aplasia, immunodeficiency and alopecia areata. In contrast, neuromyotonia, limbic encephalitis, myocarditis and taste disorders are autoantibody-mediated disorders, as is MG. Autoantibodies to several types of voltage-gated potassium channels and the related molecules can evoke various neurological and cardiac disorders. About 25% of patients with thymoma-associated MG have at least one non-motor symptom. Non-motor symptoms affect many target organs and result in a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from the impairment of quality of life to lethal conditions.

Methods We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) in children with FAP or IBS, investigating efficacy of HT on the following outcomes: abdominal pain scores, quality of life, costs and school absenteeism. Results Three RCT comparing HT to a control treatment were included with sample sizes ranging from 22 to 52 children. We refrained from statistical pooling because of low number of studies and many differences in design and outcomes. Two studies examined HT performed by a therapist, one examined HT through self-exercises on audio CD. All trials showed statistically significantly greater improvement in abdominal pain scores among children receiving HT. One trial reported beneficial effects sustained after 1\u2005year of follow-up. One trial reported statistically significant improvement in quality of life in the HT group. Two trials reported significant reductions in school absenteeism after HT. Conclusions Therapeutic effects of HT seem superior to standard medical care in children with FAP or IBS. It remains difficult to quantify exact benefits.

Methods Between October 2007 and November 2011, all neurointerventional procedures requiring access to the intracranial arterial circulation performed at our institution were reviewed. Clinical performance and complication rates of current generation guide catheters were compared with conventional guide catheters.

The aims of the current paper are to review the evidence for concussion modifiers and to consider how the evaluation and management of concussion may differ in specific groups. Methods A qualitative review of the literature on concussion was conducted with a focus on prognostic factors and specific groups including children, female athletes and elite versus non-elite players. PubMed, MEDLINE and SportsDiscus databases were reviewed. Results The literature demonstrates that number and severity of symptoms and previous concussions are associated with prolonged recovery and/or increased risk of complications. Brief loss of consciousness (LOC) and/or impact seizures do not reliably predict outcomes following a concussion, although a cautious approach should be adopted in an athlete with prolonged LOC or impact seizures (ie, >1\u2005min). Children generally take longer to recover from concussions and assessment batteries have yet to be validated in the younger age group. Currently, there are insufficient data on the influence of genetics and gender on outcomes following a concussion. Conclusions Several modifiers are associated with prolonged recovery or increased risk of complications following a concussion and have important implications for management. Children with concussion should be managed conservatively, with an emphasis on return to learn as well as return to sport. In cases of concussions managed with limited resources (eg, non-elite players), a conservative approach should also be taken.

Objective To critically revise the available literature on the comparison between the diagnostic accuracy of HE4 and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) to confirm the additional clinical value of HE4. Methods A literature search was undertaken on electronic databases and references from retrieved articles; articles were analysed according to predefined criteria. Meta-analyses for HE4 and CA-125 biomarkers with OR, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR\u2013) likelihood ratios as effect sizes were performed. Results 16 articles were originally included in meta-analyses, but two for HE4 and one for CA-125 were eliminated as outliers. Furthermore, for HE4 a publication bias was detected. ORs for both HE4 (37.2, 95% CI 19.0 to 72.7, adjusted for publication bias) and CA-125 (15.4, 95% CI 10.4 to 22.8) were significant, although in a heterogeneous set of studies (p<0.0001).

Despite corroborating data from retrospective studies, new clinical data fuel the controversy on this issue. Purpose Systematic review of the impact of the addition of PPIs to clopidogrel on platelet function and cardiovascular outcome. Data sources PubMed, Web-of-Science, Cochrane Database and reference lists of related articles. Study selection Published articles on controlled studies addressing the addition of PPIs to clopidogrel. Platelet function studies describe patients as well as healthy volunteers. Clinical studies concern patients using clopidogrel for acute coronary syndromes or because of stent implantation for stable coronary disease. Data extraction Two investigators independently reviewed the identified articles for eligibility, and one author extracted the data. Data synthesis In 70% (7/10) of the laboratory studies examining healthy volunteers on clopidogrel, addition of PPIs resulted in a significant reduction in platelet inhibition. For patients, this was observed in 11/18 (61%) studies. The 33 clinical studies showed significant heterogeneity in observed outcomes, with risk ratios for major adverse cardiovascular events varying from 0.64 to 4.58 in the case of PPI use, which was randomly allocated in only two studies. Consequently, imbalances between prognosticators at baseline and PPI prescription bias markedly contributed to the variability in results. Conclusions Despite indications of reduced antiplatelet activity ex vivo in the case of PPI administration in clopidogrel users, data on the clinical consequences are controversial. With the accumulating evidence from better designed, prospective clinical studies, an adverse effect of PPI use on clinical outcome in patients on clopidogrel cannot be substantiated.

The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host\u2013microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size.

They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionised LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines. Objectives With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring. Methodological approach On-going large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the current uncertainties, based on existing evidence. Conclusions and impact Current and planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of current IGRAs in the near future.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "68", "title": "Thorax", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Ibrahim Abubakar"}, {"name": "Helen Ruth Stagg"}, {"name": "Hilary Whitworth"}, {"name": "Ajit Lalvani"}], "KeyWords": ["interpret", "interferon", "gamma", "release", "assay", "result", "tuberculosis", "infection?"]},

Indeed, researchers have characterised subtypes of patients suffering from PD according to various criteria. Those most frequently used are the type of predominant motor symptoms (tremors or non-tremor symptoms), age at onset and presence of depression. Some characteristics, like the predominant motor subtypes, as well as the presence of depression, are more widely used to categorise cognitive differences between patients. The goal of this study was to analyse the impact of the type of predominant motor symptoms and depression on cognition in PD. A meta-analysis of 27 studies (from 1989 to 2012) was carried out to calculate the average effect size of these factors on the most often used cognitive test during those past years to evaluate cognitive skills, the Mini-Mental State Examination. The studies analysed showed significant mean weighted effect sizes on cognition for the type of motor symptoms (d=0.42; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54) and for depression (d=0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.66). These results suggested that PD participants with non-tremor predominant motor symptoms or with depression had more or more severe cognitive impairments.

Results The majority of concussions in sport occur without loss of consciousness or frank neurological signs. Some of the hallmark signs of acute concussion include mental confusion, memory and balance disturbance. Over the course of the first 24\u2005h, the most common symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness and balance problems, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, confusion, memory loss and \u2018fatigue\u2019.

In this review, we summarise these and discuss clinically relevant advances in diagnosis and treatment. In the Heart of Soweto Study, 10% of patients with newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease were HIV positive, and the most common HIV-related presentations were cardiomyopathy (38%), pericardial disease (13%) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (8%). HIV-related cardiomyopathy is more common with increased immunosuppression and HIV viraemia. With adequate antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence is low. Contributing factors such as malnutrition and genetic predisposition are under investigation. In other settings, pericardial disease is the most common presentation of HIV-related cardiovascular disease (over 40%), and over 90% of pericardial effusions are due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) pericarditis. HIV-associated TB pericarditis is associated with a greater prevalence of myopericarditis, a lower rate of progression to constriction, and markedly increased mortality. The role of steroids is currently under investigation in the form of a randomised controlled trial. HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension is significantly more common in sub-Saharan Africa than in developed countries, possibly as a result of interactions between HIV and other infectious agents, with very limited treatment options. It has recently been recognised that patients with HIV are at increased risk of sudden death. Infection with HIV is independently associated with QT prolongation, which is more marked with hepatitis C co-infection and associated with a 4.5-fold higher than expected rate of sudden death.

Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in line with recommendations from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. A comprehensive computerised search of 14 databases, supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications, from 1980 to the present, identifying rates of incongruence for cancer and/or non-cancer cohorts.

Our objective was to meta-analyse the short-term results of endoscopic and microscopic pituitary adenoma surgery. We undertook a systematic review of the English literature on results of transsphenoidal surgery, both microscopic and endoscopic from 1990 to 2011. Series with less than 10 patients were excluded. Pooled data were analysed using meta-analysis techniques to obtain estimate of death, complication rates and extent of tumour removal. Complications evaluated included cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, vascular complications, visual complications, diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism and cranial nerve injury. Data were also analysed for tumour size and sex. 38 studies met the inclusion criteria yielding 24 endoscopic and 22 microscopic datasets (eight studies included both endoscopic and microscopic series). Meta-analysis of the available literature showed that the endoscopic transsphenoidal technique was associated with a higher incidence of vascular complications (p<0.0001). No difference was found between the two techniques in all other variables examined. Meta-analysis of the available literature reveals that endoscopic removal of pituitary adenoma, in the short term, does not seem to confer any advantages over the microscopic technique and the incidence of reported vascular complications was higher with endoscopic than with microscopic removal of pituitary adenomas.

At the couple level, partners will respond to illness as an interpersonal unit rather than individuals in isolation. Research adopting a relational perspective have focused on communication, relational coping and relationship functioning and satisfaction. To our knowledge, there is no published systematic review of literature that reports associations between a couple's relationship and psychological outcomes of patients and partners affected by breast cancer. Aim To review studies that examine the impact of relational mechanisms on psychological outcomes in couples affected by breast cancer and thereby improve understanding of the connections between patient, disease and family. Methods A systematic search for literature was conducted, which was followed by a thematic analysis of study findings and a narrative synthesis. Results Sixteen papers were included. Papers were published relatively recently between 1988 and 2010. Three relational components were identified: (i) couple coping, (ii) relationship functioning and satisfaction, (iii) communication. While the literature indicates associations between relational and psychological variables, with such a small evidence base, the use of different terminology and different theoretical frameworks makes it almost impossible to draw definitive conclusions about which relational component holds greatest potential for effecting change on psychological well-being.

Results We identified 100 papers, 14 studies were included; nine evaluated leucocyte esterase (LE) dipsticks and three immunochromatographic strips, and two clinical audits of microscopy were identified. Of the field evaluations the gold standard was nucleic acid amplification technology in six studies and bacterial culture in the other six. In four studies, 50% or more of the patients were symptomatic.

Initially the body can compensate for lost circulating volume, but as haemorrhage continues compensatory mechanisms fail and the patient's condition worsens significantly. Hypovolaemia results in the lethal triad, a combination of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy, three factors that are interlinked and serve to worsen each other. The lethal triad is a form of vicious cycle, which unless broken will result in death. This report will focus on the role of hypothermia (a third of the lethal triad) in trauma, examining literature to assess how prehospital temperature control can impact on the trauma patient. Spontaneous hypothermia following trauma has severely deleterious consequences for the trauma victim; however, both active warming of patients and clinically induced hypothermia can produce particularly positive results and improve patient outcome. Possible coagulopathic side effects of clinically induced hypothermia may be corrected with topical haemostatic agents, with the benefits of an extended golden hour given by clinically induced hypothermia far outweighing these risks. Active warming of patients, to prevent spontaneous trauma induced hypothermia, is currently the only viable method currently available to improve patient outcome. This method is easy to implement requiring simple protocols and contributes significantly to interrupting the lethal triad. However, the future of trauma care appears to lie with clinically induced therapeutic hypothermia.

These findings are in agreement with a substantial mutational load predicted to occur during lifetime within the human soma. A major consequence of these results is that the genetic profile of a single tissue collected at one time point should be used with caution as a faithful portrait of other tissues from the same subject or the same tissue throughout life. Thus, the design of studies in human genetics interrogating a single sample per subject or applying lymphoblastoid cell lines may come into question. Sporadic disorders are common in medicine. We wish to stress the non-heritable genetic variation as a potentially important factor behind the development of sporadic diseases. Moreover, associations between post-zygotic mutations, clonal cell expansions and their relation to cancer predisposition are central in this context. Post-zygotic mutations are amenable to robust examination and are likely to explain a sizable part of non-heritable disease causality, which has routinely been thought of as synonymous with environmental factors.

Materials and Results This study reviewed a series of 16 children with congenital pial AVF, treated between January 2005 and August 2011. All cases presented before 5\u2005years of age and the mode of presentation varied with age. Fourteen had a single fistula while two had multiple fistulas, one among them had cutaneous features suggestive of RASA1 mutation. MRI is the preferred initial imaging, to demonstrate anatomical location, feeders, venous varix and regional, hemispheric or diffuse cerebralmalacia. Digital subtraction angiography performed during the first therapeutic attempt showed venous varix along with arterial enlargement as the most common angio-architecture. All cases were embolized with N-butyl-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) with or without coiling of the venous sac to attain flow control. Hypotension and a higher concentration of glue were used to aid controlled glue injections. Dural AVF and reactive angiogenesis are not uncommon sequlae found on follow-up angiogram. Outcomes were excellent in 75% and good in 19%. Conclusion Congenital pial AVF are caused by a missed step in vascular development during the early embryonic stage. Transarterial endovascular embolizaiton using NBCA with or without using coils to attain flow control is the treatment of choice, with low morbidity. The efficacy of treatment is high as demonstrated by the high cure rate.

Study design Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources Fourteen electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO) were searched to January 2012, and supplemented by hand-searching relevant articles.

Data Extraction Data were extracted and validity was assessed independently by two reviewers. Results Twenty-one RCTs that enrolled 6317 patients were identified (11 studies evaluated STS (10 of which were HH, while 1 was HM), 9 studies assessed TM, and 1 study assessed both STS and TM). No trial of implanted monitoring devices met the inclusion criteria.

Sarcoidosis may present rather dramatically as an acute disease, which usually resolves either spontaneously or with treatment, while other patients have an insidious onset and a chronic/progressive disease course. The different clinical phenotypes have led to the suggestion that sarcoidosis may consist of several separate entities. Yet, the characteristic immune response eventually leading to granuloma formation indicates that a number of features are common to all subgroups of the disease. Through a classical candidate gene approach, several genes of importance for sarcoidosis have been identified, and in some cases such gene variants associate with distinct clinical phenotypes. More recently, another approach to the search for sarcoidosis-associated genes has been applied, that is, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS have led to the identification of a number of new genetic associations, although several of them need to be validated. Conversely, some of the previously identified human leucocyte antigen (HLA) associations with sarcoidosis have already been replicated in different cohorts and found to be quite strong, particularly in specific patient subgroups. In highly specialised centres such HLA associations already represent a useful aid in clinic practice for improving patient management.

Substantive progress has been made since then with the identification of 18 autoinflammatory genes accounting for up to 24 disease entities showing overlapping symptoms. The accumulation of studies reporting patients with missing or excess mutations as compared with expected numbers favours the hypothesis that these diseases are distributed along a continuum ranging from monogenic to multifactorial conditions, rather than featuring only classical modes of inheritance.

In some cases, however, symptoms may be prolonged or complications may develop. The objectives of the current paper are to review the literature regarding the difficult concussion and to provide recommendations for an approach to the investigation and management of patients with persistent symptoms. Methods A qualitative review of the literature on concussion in sport was conducted with a focus on prolonged recovery, long-term complications and management including investigation and treatment strategies. MEDLINE and Sports Discus databases were reviewed. Results Persistent symptoms (>10\u2005days) are generally reported in 10\u201315% of concussions. This figure may be higher in certain sports (eg, ice hockey) and populations (eg, children). In general, symptoms are not specific to concussion and it is important to consider and manage coexistent pathologies. Investigations may include formal neuropsychological testing and conventional neuroimaging to exclude structural pathology. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine clinical use of advanced neuroimaging techniques or genetics markers. Preliminary studies demonstrate the potential benefit of subsymptom threshold activity as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme.

Monitoring SHS exposure (SHSe) in indoor environments provides useful information on the extent and consequences of SHSe, implementing and evaluating tobacco control programmes and behavioural interventions, and estimating overall burden of disease caused by SHSe. The most widely used markers have been vapour-phase nicotine and respirable particulate matter (PM). Numerous other environmental analytes of SHS have been measured in the air including carbon monoxide, 3-ethenylpyridine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes and volatile organic compounds, as well as nicotine in dust and on surfaces. The measurement of nicotine in the air has the advantage of reflecting the presence of tobacco smoke. While PM measurements are not as specific, they can be taken continuously, allowing for assessment of exposure and its variation over time. In general, when nicotine and PM are measured in the same setting using a common sampling period, an increase in nicotine concentration of 1\u2005\u03bcg/m3 corresponds to an average increase of 10\u2005\u03bcg/m3 of PM.

Similarly, new hybrid open surgery endovascular treatment can minimise the surgical insult to these often critically ill elderly patients. Together, these changes can change the previously grim prognosis associated with this condition.

The authors describe their experience treating aneurysms at a single high-volume tertiary care center, focusing particularly on the use of adjunctive devices. Methods A retrospective review was undertaken of all the aneurysms treated at the Cleveland Clinic between 2003 and 2010. Results A total of 1455 aneurysms were treated (45% subarachnoid hemorrhage). In 2003, aneurysms were treated equally with clipping (49.6%) and coiling (50.4%). Over the 8-year period reviewed there was a decline in the percentage of aneurysms treated surgically. By 2010, 25.5% of aneurysms were treated surgically and 74.5% by endovascular coiling. Among aneurysms that were coiled there was an increase in the cases treated with adjuncts including balloon remodeling and stents.

The prevalence of adult OSA is increasing because of a worldwide increase in obesity and the ageing of populations. OSA presents with a variety of symptoms the most prominent of which are snoring and daytime tiredness. Interestingly though, a significant proportion of OSA sufferers report little or no daytime symptoms. OSA has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive abnormalities and mental health problems. Randomised controlled trial evidence is awaited to confirm a causal relationship between OSA and these various disorders. The gold standard diagnostic investigation for OSA is overnight laboratory-based polysomnography (sleep study), however, ambulatory models of care incorporating screening questionnaires and home sleep studies have been recently evaluated and are now being incorporated into routine clinical practice. Patients with OSA are very often obese and exhibit a range of comorbidities, such as hypertension, depression and diabetes. Management, therefore, needs to be based on a multidisciplinary and holistic approach which includes lifestyle modifications. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line therapy for severe OSA. Oral appliances should be considered in patients with mild or moderate disease, or in those unable to tolerate CPAP. New, minimally invasive surgical techniques are currently being developed to achieve better patient outcomes and reduce surgical morbidity.

Optimal treatment of ACL injury requires individualised management. Patient selection is of utmost importance, and so is respect for the patient's functional demands and interests. All patients with an ACL tear may not need surgery, however athletes and persons with an active lifestyle with high knee functional demands including cutting motions need and should be offered surgery. In many cases it may not be the choice of graft or technique that is the key for success, but the choice of surgeon. The surgeon should be experienced and use a reconstructive procedure he/she knows very well and is comfortable with. The development of osteoarthritis after an ACL injury depends very much on the injury mechanism and concurrent meniscal injury, as knee articular cartilage continues to heal for 1\u20132\u2005years after an ACL injury. Therefore the surgeon and rehabilitation team must pay attention to the rehabilitation process and to the decision when to return to sport. Return to sport must be carefully considered, as top-level sport in itself is one main risk factor for osteoarthritis after ACL injury. The present criteria for return to sport need to be revisited, also due to the fact that recurrent injury seems to be an increasing problem. ACL injury prevention programmes are now available in some sports. The key issue for a prevention programme to be successful is proper implementation. Vital factors for success include the individual coaching of the player and well controlled compliance with the training programme.

Data sources 18 databases were searched from inception to June 2010. Relevant websites and reference lists of included studies were checked for additional publications. Study selection Randomised controlled trials in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries that evaluated the effectiveness of specialist clinic interventions for heart failure compared with usual care, where unplanned heart failure admissions or readmissions were an outcome. Data extraction Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Results 10 of 17 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Specialist clinics showed a reduction in unplanned admissions at 12 months (pooled risk ratio (RR) for five studies 0.51 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.76); absolute risk reduction 16 per 100 (95% CI 12 to 20)).

Research methods have studied contributing factors for diagnostic error in both naturalistic and experimental settings. Both approaches have revealed important and complementary information. Newer conceptual models from outside healthcare are needed to advance the depth and rigour of analysis of systems and cognitive insights of causes of error. While the literature has suggested many potentially fruitful interventions for reducing diagnostic errors, most have not been systematically evaluated and/or widely implemented in practice. Research is needed to study promising intervention areas such as enhanced patient involvement in diagnosis, improving diagnosis through the use of electronic tools and identification and reduction of specific diagnostic process \u2018pitfalls\u2019 (eg, failure to conduct appropriate diagnostic evaluation of a breast lump after a \u2018normal\u2019 mammogram).

This bacterium may also cause localised chronic infections with no intestinal symptoms: endocarditis, central nervous system involvement, arthritis, uveitis and spondylodiscitis. An impaired TH1 immune response is seen. T whipplei replication in vitro is dependent on interleukin 16 and is accompanied by the apoptosis of host cells, facilitating dissemination of the bacterium. In patients with arthritis, PCR with samples of joint fluid, saliva and stools has become the preferred examination for diagnosis. Immunohistochemical staining is also widely used for diagnosis. Treatment is based on recent microbiological data, but an immune reconstitution syndrome and recurrence remain possible.

Future investigations employing rigorous designs, including intervention studies, are needed to support effective HPV vaccine promotion among men.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "89", "title": "Sexually Transmitted Infections", "corpusName": "bmj"}, "publicationDate": "2013", "authors": [{"name": "Peter A Newman"}, {"name": "Carmen H Logie"}, {"name": "Nick Doukas"}, {"name": "Kenta Asakura"}], "KeyWords": ["HPV", "vaccine", "acceptability", "among", "men:", "systematic", "review", "meta-analysis"]}]
