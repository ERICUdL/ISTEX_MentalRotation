On the one hand, it is unevenly distributed, with only some compounds or elements distinguished by a large number of polymorphs or allotropes. On the other hand, many crystal structure are predicted, which can exist in principle. We argue that this imbalance may derive form an imperfect knowledge of transformation mechanisms, which solely determine the formation of a certain product. Especially in a scenario of nucleation and growth, reasoning on the mechanical stability of the final product only may mislead the overall judgement on the accessibility of a particular compound. We illustrate mechanistic analysis of selected reconstructive phase transitions by state of the art accelerated molecular dynamics techniques. We emphasize the role of nucleation in phase selection, and stress the necessary inclusion of details on intermediate steps for a more capable crystal structure prediction activity.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "11", "title": "Chemical Modelling: Volume 11", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2015", "authors": [{"name": "Stefano Leoni"}, {"name": "Salah Eddine Boulfelfel"}, {"name": "Igor A.

Altogether 364 papers are discussed in this chapter but the total number of related publications is significantly higher. The limitations in the extent of each chapter rules out the evaluation of all papers published in this period therefore we focused on the most characteristic examples of the different aspects of the coordination chemistry of these ligands. The basic findings for the metal complexes of amino acids and peptides have already been satisfactorily clarified in the past few decades and now the derivatives and various applications are in the centre of studies. For amino acids we followed the classical dissection of published results, namely the structural, equilibrium and kinetic investigations are collected in separate paragraphs followed by some important applications. The increasing number of theoretical and gas phase studies justifies the summary of related articles also in a separates subsection. In the case of peptides the wide spread application of solid phase peptide synthesis gave a big impetus to studies on their metal complexes especially for the biologically important ligands. Therefore, in the second part of the chapter a new classification of the results was followed.

In this chapter an outline is provided to summarise recent advances, together with the brief references to early attempts, on strategies and approaches developed for identification of protein epitopes, for the manipulation of their structure to achieve optimal immune recognition. By the help of selected examples from the last few years we also survey the application of these discoveries in understanding the details of interactions between proteins, peptides, in the development of epitope based immunodiagnostics or therapeutics.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "39", "title": "Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins: Volume 39", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2015", "authors": [{"name": "Katalin Uray"}, {"name": "Ferenc Hudecz"}], "KeyWords": ["Peptide", "epitopes:", "identification", "structural", "modifications", "synthetic", "antigens"]},

Despite the major impact of native chemical ligation, which has rendered complex peptides and proteins available by chemical means, improvements to this technique are still being sought which would greatly facilitate the access to many peptide/protein targets. In this book chapter, the recent progresses towards: (1) cysteine-free ligation through the use of cysteine surrogates; (2) the development of practical thioester surrogates and promising alternatives to NCL are presented.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "39", "title": "Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins: Volume 39", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2015", "authors": [{"name": "Ana\u00efs F.

The details of singlet oxygen photosensitisation by organic dyes are well understood as well as its limitations. Novel materials and biomaterials with unprecedented optical, photophysical, and biological properties, as well as novel chemical and biological technologies have recently emerged that provide new opportunities for the controlled generation and delivery of singlet oxygen in biological media as well as for its detection and monitoring. This review summarises such novel contributions, ranging from stimulus-responsive switchable molecular photosensitisers to proteins as novel photoactive biotherapeutic drugs to metallic nanostructures as plasmonic antennas for singlet oxygen.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "42", "title": "Photochemistry: Volume 42", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2015", "authors": [{"name": "Oriol Planas"}, {"name": "Ester Boix-Garriga"}, {"name": "Beatriz Rodr\u00edguez-Amigo"}, {"name": "Joaquim Torra"}, {"name": "Roger Bresol\u00ed-Obach"}, {"name": "Cristina Flors"}, {"name": "Cristiano Viappiani"}, {"name": "Montserrat Agut"}, {"name": "Rub\u00e9n Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez"}, {"name": "Santi Nonell"}], "KeyWords": ["Chapter", "9", "-", "Newest", "approaches", "singlet", "oxygen", "photosensitisation", "biological", "media"]},
