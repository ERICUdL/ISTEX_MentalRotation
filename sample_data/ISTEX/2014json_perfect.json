Yet it will continue to be the cornerstone and a key mission of higher education. Hence the tide is shifting and the global debate on \u201cthe world-class university\u201d is increasingly inclusive towards excellence in teaching and learning. A renewed focus on liberal arts education is part of this global debate on redefining excellence. This article aims to explain why liberal arts education, as it is (re)emerging in different regions, seems to be an adequate response to the search for excellence in the 21st century. It explores the drivers for liberal arts education from an epistemological, economic and a social-moral point of view. The role of interdisciplinarity, generic skills, and citizenship in different regional context are discussed, and also an admission that a liberal arts education is no panacea\u2014that various limitations should be overcome and a truly global perspective is needed.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "2", "title": "International Journal of Chinese Education", "corpusName": "brill-journals"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Marijk van der Wende"}], "KeyWords": ["Trends", "towards", "Global", "Excellence", "Undergraduate", "Education:", "Taking", "Liberal", "Arts", "Experience", "21st", "Century"]},

Under this point of view, scattering and diffraction techniques are extremely useful and informative.

This chapter offers brief introductions on wide-angle X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, and light scattering, and it presents a number of examples where these techniques were determinant for the investigation.

Hence thermoset materials are to be toughened for many end-use applications. One of the most important methods for toughening epoxy resins is the incorporation of a secondary phase in the thermoset matrix. Functionalized liquid rubbers are one of the major toughener phases employed. The liquid rubber is compatible with epoxy resin before curing at the curing temperature. During cure of thermoset resins with hardener and rubbers phase separation takes place. The phase separated elastomer domains will toughen the matrix by different mechanism. The extent of toughness characteristics depend on the size, distribution and nature of elastomer domains. Mechanical properties including tensile strength, fracture toughness and impact properties are higher in elastomer toughened matrices compared to pristine thermosets. Elastomer incorporation changes the Tg of the matrix. Owing to the low modulus nature of elastomers there is slight compromise in thermal characteristics compared to virgin thermosets.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "1", "title": "Natural Rubber Materials: Volume 1: Blends and IPNs", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Raju Thomas"}, {"name": "Ishak Ahmad"}, {"name": "Sahrim Hj.

This paper explores the implications of that lack of clarity, focusing in particular on gaps in the international law regulating the conduct of peacekeepers. The author argues that the current approach, whereby prosecution for crimes committed by peacekeepers is dealt with primarily through the domestic law of the Troop Contributing State, is unsatisfactory, and is likely to remain unsatisfactory despite efforts to persuade Contributing States\u2019 to establish the legal and administrative frameworks necessary to prosecute and punish their troops for crimes committed outside their territorial borders. A convention based regime specifically tailored to ensuring that peacekeepers are held accountable to internationally agreed standards would be the most effective way of enabling the UN to comply with the rule of law standards it itself espouses.2 Such a regime would enable the UN to retain legitimacy internationally and in the eyes of the communities where missions are deployed. In addition the UN should expand its Office of Internal Oversight Services to encompass a dedicated fully resourced criminal justice unit.3 Arguably the accountability gap in relation to non-military personnel is even greater than for military personnel since, although troops generally have complete immunity from prosecution in the host State under a Status of Forces Agreement, they are normally covered by their home State\u2019s military justice system; whereas non-military personnel have functional immunity in the Host State, under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations,4 but may not be subject to the jurisdiction of their home State at all whilst they are deployed abroad.5 However not all Troop Contributing States have independent codes of military justice operating in peacetime, and in those countries that do not, responsibility for punishing any wrong-doing by military personnel falls to the ordinary courts and disciplinary bodies.6 In addition some countries have removed serious crimes that violate human rights from the jurisdiction of military courts.7 But even where military personnel are subject to their home State\u2019s military justice system, and it covers the crime in question, Troop Contributing States are often reluctant to prosecute.8 Since the track record on holding UN troops accountable for crimes and other serious misconduct remains poor; and since the majority of allegations of crimes and misconduct reported in the press continues to be against soldiers; and since soldiers outnumber other personnel in UN operations by a wide margin,9 this paper focuses in particular on military personnel.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "4", "title": "Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies", "corpusName": "brill-journals"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Prof. dr.

A series of intellectual manoeuvres creates the appearance of a relatively stable, knowable and measurable system. These include confusion over the precise object of study, omission of anything that does not fit the theory and rigid techniques of closure that prevent these weaknesses being evident. Critiques of Eurocentrism raise broader questions of processes of power/knowledge by which the discourse of Indonesians is culturally translated into the hegemonic language of an \u00e9lite of experts, producers and politicians. The paper proposes instead to approach Indonesian media as assemblages of practices of production, distribution, engagement and use by different people in different situations. Such practices constitute performances, which may be differently articulated by different participants on different occasions. The paper concludes by rethinking key genres of Indonesian television broadcasting as performances.

Cellular membranes are based on lipid bilayer vesicles, which provide a boundary layer, keeping the cellular building blocks localized and protected from external chemicals. Cell membranes are also more than mere containers, the lipid bilayers serve as a platform for proteins, and the interactions between lipids and proteins leads to multiple functions, such as cell motility, molecular transport, and cell division. These cellular functions are being implemented in synthetic systems through the bottom-up synthetic biology of interfaces. We discuss the different types of interfaces that have been utilized, from liposomes, through to polymer membranes, protein capsules, and emulsions. The ability to engineer membrane building blocks and heirarchies can lead to membrane systems that are intrinsically responsive. We then highlight how additional cellular processes can be recreated in these systems through the interplay between the boundary material and embedded molecules.

Particularly, the reactivity of vinyl and allyl ethers derived from selected sugars was examined in donor-acceptor copolymerization with butenedioates (diethyl fumarate, DEF, or diethyl maleate, DEM) used as acceptor co-monomers. The reactivity of selected pairs of monomers was studied from the viewpoints of polymerization rates and of copolymerization mechanism. Kinetic studies confirmed the higher reactivity of vinyl ethers with respect to allyl analogs, the latter leading to extensive transfer reactions evidenced by the lower molecular weight of the resulting polymers and by the nature of the end groups. Vinyloxy monomers yield regular alternating copolymers with high molecular weight when copolymerized in undiluted liquid blends. Allyloxy monomers polymerized in the presence of DEF typically undergo random copolymerization with DEF homopropagation, as well as the dominant occurrence of transfer reactions as end of growth mechanism. The influence of structural factors, of dilution and of stoichiometry on the reactivity was examined in details so as to optimize polymerization efficiency. Some examples of possible routes towards pentose-based networks illustrate the approach using allyloxy model derivatives, polymerization of hybrid donor-acceptor monomers as well as the copolymerization of a multifunctional xyloside bearing several electron-donor unsaturations together with an acceptor comonomer.

As a result they made improvements in mathematics, astronomy, and physics. They kept work alive on magnetism and electricity; they corrected the calendar; they improved maps both of the earth and the sky. As teachers they influenced others, and their method of argumentation encouraged rigorous logic and the use of experiment in the pursuit of science.

Blending also provides an unusual combination of mechanical, thermal, chemical and morphological properties. Polymer blends are being used extensively in numerous applications. They play an important role in the fabrication of various products for applications ranging from footwear to space vehicles. A blend of elastic, rubbery polymers with a rigid plastics form thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). These materials have the processing characteristics of a thermoplastic and the functional performance of a conventional rubber. They possess a wide range of physical properties of conventional elastomers at room and service temperatures in combination with the excellent processing characteristics of thermoplastic materials at high temperature. Such materials can be reprocessed, display good processability and have economic advantages. There is a wide variety of commercially available rubbers and plastics that can be considered for the preparation of TPEs. Different types of rubbers like NR, ENR, SBR, NBR, EPDM, XSBR, XNBR, etc. and different types of thermoplastics like PP, PVC, PS, PMMA, polyamides, nylons, LDPE, HDPE, etc. are used for blending to prepare TPEs. In rubber-modified thermoplastics, rubber improves the impact strength and ductility of the plastic and the plastic increases the stiffness of the rubber. A thermoplastic material known as thermoplastic natural rubber (TPNR) is produced on blending thermoplastic with NR. A variety of TPNRs have been developed by blending NR with polystyrene, polyamide 6, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and poly(methyl methacrylate), etc. The research into the preparation and evaluation of TPNR was initiated in the early 1960s at the Malaysian Rubber Producers\u2019 Research Association (MRPRA) in London. TPNRs, with their unique properties, find use in various fields like packaging industries, manufacturing of household materials, automotive industries, biomedical applications, space technology etc. Natural rubber is characterized by good elastic properties, good resilience and damping behaviour but poor chemical resistance and processability. On the other hand, thermoplastics exhibit superior processing characteristics. However, it is extremely brittle. TPNRs from are expected to exhibit good processability, impact strength, good flexibility and rubbery nature. The properties the blend depend upon the way in which the blends are prepared, the nature of the homopolymers and additives used, and the amount of constituents.

The fourth argument is that \u201cde-Westernisation\u201d suggests that the theory and methods of Media Studies offer nothing of use outside their original birthplaces, while the fifth argument is the conceptual danger of nativism. The sixth critique centres on the problem of essentialising culture as a determinate object.

Such techniques will also play a key role in the emergence of Synthetic Biology as a major route to harnessing complex biological systems that address the growing needs of a global society for better healthcare, sustainable energy, and sufficient food. The synthesis of pharmaceuticals, fuels and other chemicals, will increasingly rely on non oil-based feedstocks such as sustainable biomass. This will require novel metabolic pathways, containing specifically evolved enzymes, to be engineered into suitable host cells. By engineering a cell's proteins, it is also possible to engineer a cell with novel functions. Ambitions to create synthetic cells with entirely artificial, orthogonal or synthetic cell biology, including non-natural DNA, RNA, amino-acid, and protein analogues, will inevitably require extensive engineering of proteins using directed evolution.

Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes consisting of sp2 bonds show a wide potential window and are low cost materials in comparison to metal electrodes such as gold or platinum. The electrochemical activity of graphitic electrodes such as GC and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) depends mainly on surface roughness and on the amount and kind of surface oxygen functions. Recently, new carbon-based materials including boron-doped diamond (BDD), BDD nanowire electrodes and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted considerable interest for electroanalytical applications. While BDD electrodes exhibit enlarged potential windows with low capacitive currents as compared to GC advantageous for electrocatalysis and electro-oxidation of organic compounds, the electron transfer rate is for several analytics (e.g; dopamine) slower at BDD electrodes than on conventional carbon electrodes. The reduction in sp2 carbon prevents catecholamines and nucleic acids to increase the electron transfer through the formation of \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions with BDD electrodes, preventing often biomolecular detection with good sensitivity and selectivity on unmodified BDD interfaces. The last decade has thus, in parallel, seen an extraordinary amount of research devoted to the electrochemical properties of nanometer sized sp2 hybridized carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and most recently graphene-based electrodes. The rapidly growing interest in graphene and related materials such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is due to the promising electrochemical characteristics such as large potential window, fast heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics and increased capacitance of these materials.

Estimation of threats to the birds resulting from building of wind farms is a very difficult task and it must take into account several constrains. The basic task is to build farms in localities that are the safest to birds. This can be achieved by pre-investment monitoring and direct observations at the spot and then evaluation of potential threats and risks. Field methods typical for the studies on bird populations are usually applied in such monitoring. The procedure described below includes four steps: screening (starts the process and sets preliminary constrains of the location), monitoring (standardised data are collected at the location), estimations of potential collision risk and evaluation of the location. The key parameters determining collision risk of bird species are: (1) the number of individuals utilising the monitored area in different seasons, (2) air space utilization (height and directions of flights), as well as (3) characteristics of the species behaviour. The starting data set contains: species name, number of individuals, height of flight (three layers - below, in, above the rotor), and distance from the observer. The final estimation of the collision index (the most probable number of collisions per turbine a year) is based on (1) estimation of the total number of individuals that use the defined area during a year and (2) estimation of probability that the individual will collide. In the latter (i.e. 2) the most important is that birds can actively avoid passing through the rotor swept (active avoidance rate) and that even birds, which crossed the rotor swept area not necessarily will be killed. Calculations are performed for each species separately and then are summarised to get the farm index as well as season indices. Some values of indices for raptors studied at 76 localities in Poland are given in the table.

Switching from one to the other is frequently considered as a problem that cannot be solved using specific solutions. Although both techniques have followed a parallel but very different evolution since their introduction in the early 1930s, the concept of Raman-in-SEM first began in the 1980s and the first commercial systems were marketed in the early 2000s. The two main systems and techniques that have been developed and marketed by three manufacturers are presented and described in this chapter. An evaluation of their advantages and limitations is proposed. A metrological study is then proposed for one of these systems, based on the \u2018on-axis\u2019 technique using a curved mirror placed under the SEM pole piece. This study allows a discussion of the performance and limitations of Raman spectroscopy when performed in a SEM. A comprehensive review of published work is provided, although papers are rare in the open literature. The technique is essentially used for controls, expert assessments and high technology applications. Advanced techniques that allow the use of Raman-in-SEM spectroscopy are discussed in detail using application examples taken from different fields in geosciences, materials chemistry or from expert assessments. The conclusions of this study show that Raman-in-SEM spectroscopy is to date the first step in the combination of two well-known and mature techniques enabling the synergy between them to be maximised. Raman-in-SEM spectroscopy is relatively easy to set up and effectively complements the capabilities and efficiency of analytical SEM for material characterization. What are the most likely development perspectives that may be considered for this analytical coupling?

The classifications of these systems can be divided into two categories, i.e. miscibility and immiscibility.

Anyway, the miscibility of blends is difficult to identify by simple observation. For example, some blends are looked to be miscible blends but they are really immiscible. This miscibility can be predicted by the basic thermodynamic Gibbs free energy. Furthermore, the miscibility of these systems can also be analysed and confirmed by several techniques, such as thermal analysis (i.e. differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, etc.), microscopic analysis (i.e. transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy), scattering analysis, and infrared spectroscopy.

A Critical Engagement with Key Events and Contemporary Quests for the Historical Jesus", "abstract": "Key Events is clearly a major contribution to historical Jesus studies from a broadly evangelical perspective. While there is much to commend and a number of strong essays, there are, inevitably criticisms to be made. A number of arguments appear to be repeating debates from the 1980s and 1990s with a familiar cast of good (e.g. N.T. Wright), bad (e.g. Burton Mack, Jesus Seminar) and ambivalent (e.g. E.P. Sanders) characters. This nostalgic feel means that alternative understandings of the historical Jesus and wider issues of history and historical change are not properly discussed, although clearly the opportunities were present among the contributors of Key Events. There is a sustained discussion of historical change in the chapter on resurrection but this repeats problematic arguments in favour of the historicity of the resurrection in what is effectively an attempt to prove what is historically unprovable. Finally, to lesser or greater extent, a number of essays in Key Events continue to perpetuate the idea of a \u2018Jewish \u2026 but not that Jewish\u2019 Jesus through monolithic constructions of Jews and Judaism and through the discredited criterion of dissimilarity in disguise: double dissimilarity. It is not always clear that the problematic criterion of double dissimilarity is applied consistently, with some evidence of contributors forgetting aspects of dissimilarity from Christianity while never forgetting dissimilarity from Judaism (even when similar Jewish evidence is, in fact, available). These criticisms should not take away from a number of positive contributions made to historical Jesus studies and it may be that Key Events represents a vision of what most historical Jesus scholars see as the future of the sub-field.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "11", "title": "Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus", "corpusName": "brill-journals"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "James G.

Among the potential end products, C2+ alcohols are desirable since they serve as clean alternative fuels, gasoline blends, and hydrogen carriers to supply fuel cells. There are a number of literature reports that focus on the synthesis of ethanol from syngas. However, compared to ethanol, C3+ alcohols may have wider use as gasoline substitutes due to their higher energy density, lower hygroscopicity and lower volatility. In addition, branched-chain alcohols (such as isobutanol) have higher octane numbers than their straight-chain linear counterparts. However, there are very few literature reports focusing on the synthesis of alcohols higher than ethanol. Hence this review focuses on the synthesis of higher alcohols, particularly isobutanol, by addressing current synthesis methods, thermodynamics of syngas conversion to these oxygenates, catalytic reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and future directions, which could serve as building blocks for further research in this area.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "26", "title": "Catalysis: Volume 26", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Nachal Subramanian"}, {"name": "Adeyiga Adeyinka"}, {"name": "James J.

Innovations of enabling materials (catalysts, adsorbents, membranes), efficient processing schemes, robust products portfolios and smart business strategies are needed to close the priority gap between fossil and the more complex renewable resources. Co-production of (platform) chemicals and bio-products can improve the economical basis. Options for thermochemical processing towards fuels include the pyrolysis route, which is proceeding via bio-oil (BO) upgrading, and the alternative gasification route, which is proceeding via syngas followed by catalytic synthesis, e.g. Fischer-Tropsch. The number of conditioning and conversion steps that can be envisaged along both routes needs to be minimized. Basic pretreatment of raw BO is chemical stabilization, which enables its storage or transport. More advanced upgrading is required to reach oil qualities suitable for heat and power, and even more advanced for transport applications (including aviation fuel). Catalysts and hydrogen can provide the required processing flexibility and product quality. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is one of the most attractive upgrading options, enabling removal of heteroatoms, adding energy, and chemical transformations for tuning of properties. This review focuses on HDO and the catalytic properties of metal carbides, nitrides and phosphides, the potential of mesoporous-based catalytic materials, and also of noble metals.

Therefore, the diffusion and transport behaviour through many types of rubber have been studied by various modified techniques and standard methods in order to classify the barrier properties of natural rubber, natural rubber composites and nanocomposites. Generally, a natural rubber has low resistance to gas and moisture diffusion, resulting in degradation and shortened shelf life. Research projects have been conducted for a long time to discover strategies to overcome these drawbacks of natural rubber. Improving the barrier performance is an objective to prevent liquids, vapours and gases passing through the natural rubber easily. There are various processes and methods to achieve this goal. Preparation in the form of natural rubber composites has been used for this intention about 40 years. Due to the boom in nanotechnology, nanocomposites have been discussed for their advantages including ease of manufacturing, light weight and high barrier against diffusion and transport of moisture and gases. Conventional composites and nanocomposites are the same in combination of two or more materials; the rubber as a main material for continuous phase called matrix and other materials called dispersed phase with difference in nano size of nanocomposites. These methods are interesting to improve various properties in many applications.

The Shannon-Wiener general diversity indices varied among the habitats and ranged from 2.323 to 3.458. Richness (5.813-11.410), evenness (0.406-0.641) and dominance (0.042-0.128) indices also varied considerably among the study locations. The highest diversity, the lowest dominance and a very high evenness were characteristics of miscellaneous plantations. Grasslands showed highest evenness and considerably high species diversity. The lowest avian evenness and diversity were recorded in wetlands and swamp forests. Insectivorous birds were most numerous (53), followed by carnivorous (40), omnivorous (29) and frugivorous (15) birds.

It notes the growth of a variety of transborder-based Chinese cinema cultures, ranging from blockbuster productions to independent documentary culture, and argues that similar phenomena can be found in other parts of East Asia and with other arts and media. Until now, the tendency has been to tag such phenomena as \u201ctransnational\u201d without further elaboration. This essay argues that the time has come for a more rigorous interrogation of the transnational. It argues that the transnational order should be distinguished from both the earlier international order of nation-states and from the ideology of globalisation. Further, it argues that the cultural formations that grow under the logic of transnational and flexible production operate not as part of a stable national system but according to the contingent and fluid logic of assemblage.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "41", "title": "Asian Journal of Social Science", "corpusName": "brill-journals"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Berry"}], "KeyWords": ["Transnational", "Culture", "East", "Asia", "Logic", "Assemblage"]},

The reinforcing fillers play a significant role in increasing or at least maintaining the strength of rubber composites, while the non-reinforcing fillers are added to reduce cost. The filler reinforcement in rubber composites depends on particle size, the structure of filler particles, and surface activity. As particle size decreases (from micro to nano), the surface area increases, providing more available contact between the rubber molecule and the filler particle. The high structure filler exhibits a high number of primary particles per aggregate, which is called strong aggregation, whereas low structure fillers show only weak aggregation. These aggregates may form loose agglomerates linked by van der Waals interactions. Fillers that have chemically active surfaces from various chemical groups provide good interaction between rubber and filler through the formation of strong covalent bonding. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature of rubber and filler also influence the compatibility and dispersibility of a filler in the rubber matrix. Basically, the addition of reinforcing fillers will improve mechanical properties but reduce the elasticity of rubber composites. The reinforcement of rubber with nanoparticle fillers combines the elastic behaviour of rubber with the strength and stiffness of the reinforcing phase.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "2", "title": "Natural Rubber Materials: Volume 2: Composites and Nanocomposites", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Azura A.

It also takes a closer look at how instrumental narratives behind these events constrain community involvement. Our findings suggest that both cities adopted an instrumental approach to their cultural festivals. In both cases, the instrumental focus of festival organizers curtails community participation, by focusing on professionalism in both the public and private sectors. Community groups challenged the approach at different levels. We argue that cultural festivals are places where different narratives, such as goal-oriented instrumentalism and self-realisation, interact, compete, and negotiate with each other.

Recent general reviews of phosphine ligand chemistry relevant to the catalysis area have provided coverage of recent developments in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral phosphines, (and other classes of organophosphorus compound), the synthesis of planar chiral phosphines derived from [2,2]paracyclophane, routes to P-stereogenic oligomers, polymers and related cyclic phosphines, and the stoichiometric and catalytic synthesis of alkynylphosphines.

Alternatively to the Williamson reaction, catalytic approaches aiming at opening salt free accesses to ethers have more recently emerged. This evolution is pushed by the growing interest dedicated to greener synthetic approaches that find a particular echo in the field of carbohydrates chemistry. This chapter sets up a panorama of the methods used to access ethers derived from the free hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates/polyols. This overview of course includes the stoichiometric Williamson reaction, largely and even, in some cases, routinely employed at the laboratory and industrial scales. A particular attention is given to the recent developments in protecting groups for multistep synthesis and the large scale production of alkylcelluloses.

It has a wide linear viscoelastic window with low hysteresis.

Natural rubber is adaptable through crosslink density, blending with other polymers and addition of fillers, with carbon black and silica being most important. Nanofillers offer greater adaption at small volume fractions with variation of geometry, surface area and coupling agents at the interface.

We aim to use synthetic biology to construct enzyme complexes mimicking those in nature but with new catalytic properties. This review offers an account of some of the current synthetic biology approaches undertaken based on the \u201cshare-your-parts\u201d principle to engineer chloroplasts into light-driven effective production units for high value bio-active natural products such as pharmaceutically important structurally complex diterpenoids. The synthesis of most bio-active natural products involves biosynthetic steps catalysed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Re-routing of such biosynthetic pathways into the chloroplast is possible as demonstrated with the pathway for the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. This constitutes an ideal proof-of-concept model system because all the genes and enzymes involved are well characterized. Photosystem I is the key and unique bio-brick used in these synthetic biology efforts with ferredoxin constituting an eminent electron donor of reducing equivalents to cytochrome P450s anchored in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. Approaches to further optimize and channel the use of reducing power from photosystem I into the production of bio-active natural products based on construction of a supramolecular metabolon composed of photosystem I into which the catalytic globular domains of cytochrome P450s have been incorporated are presented and discussed. The chloroplast is an ideal production unit for diterpenoids because it is the site of synthesis of the universal precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate. The technologies available and advances made in identifying and characterizing the genes and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of complex diterpenoids are outlined and illustrated with the \u201csilver bullet drug\u201d forskolin as an example. More than 50.000 terpenoids have been detected in plants, making terpenoids the richest repository for chemicals with a wide range of bioactivities. An ultimate goal of the use of synthetic biology within this research area is to design a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d template-based production system that on a long-term basis can contribute to production of otherwise extremely costly medicinal compounds.

Addressing this behavior as the tourist syndrome, he proposes to treat the contemporary meaning of social interaction as inseparable from the consumption of sensations and looseness of ties. This is most apparent in the case of leisure travel where the organization of escapism is premised on the excitement of rapidly changing scenery and absence of belonging. In these scenarios of impermanence, order and regularity are overshadowed by the impulse for disengagement, flexibility and transience. Yet the fluidity of travel is not simply a metaphor for the fading of structured expectations, ordered modalities and patterned perceptions. Many people exposed to the asperity of being on the road do not want to be alienated from the familiar and the predictable. A description of Malaysian travellers on packaged tours suggests that their attraction to the liquid sensationalism of distant travels does not necessarily rule out the predilection for order and habitual attachments.

An Analysis of UN\u2019s Naming and Shaming of Child Abusers in Armed Conflict", "abstract": "The impact of armed conflict on children has been recognized for some time as a major humanitarian problem. In 1999, the United Nations (UN) Security Council began taking up the abuse of children during armed conflict as a regular thematic issue. As part of the protective framework, the UN adopted a \u201cstrategy\u201d of \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d government forces and rebel groups recruiting, killing, maiming, raping or other sexual abusing of children during conflict. The philosophical justification of the public exposures is premised on the supposed stigmatic and deterrent effect on named and shamed offenders. However, little analysis has gone into the impact of this UN policy. This paper has the modest aim of assessing the UN\u2019s naming and shaming practice since inception of the policy in 2002. The efficacy of shaming sanctions is contestable. The recent UN annual statistics on the exposed parties do not seem to evince a convincing causal link between of naming and shaming and adherence to international humanitarian law and international human rights law, particularly among armed non-State groups (ANSAs) so far. Naming and shaming represents an antagonistic modus operandi. This paper argues that humanitarian engagement with ANSAs offers a non-confrontational and corrective approach and thus greater promise for compliance and protection of children during armed conflict than naming and shaming.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "4", "title": "Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies", "corpusName": "brill-journals"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "C.

A lot of progress has been made to understand the fracture of rubber since the development of Tearing Energy Theory by Rivlin and Thomas. However, by no means that the story is completed. The phenomenon of knotty tearing or deviation of crack propagation from the intended path is still not fully understood, although this phenomenon was discovered by Kirchoff in 1930s. It is well accepted that knotty tearing is the principal mechanism by which filler enhances the tear resistance of vulcanized filled rubber. The occurrence of knotty tearing in unfilled natural rubber vulcanized latex film is still a mystery because knotty tearing does not occur in unfilled vulcanizate prepared from dry natural rubber (SMR L). In certain vulcanized filled-rubbers, the tearing energy is still high even in the absence of the development of knotty tearing. This latter issue is still not resolved although one can associate the enhancement with energy dissipation or hysteresis.This chapter discusses the factors affecting the development of knotty tearing in terms of the degree of strain-crystallization, the glass-transition temperature, types of vulcanization system. How does pre-stressing and prestraining affect strength and durability of black-filled vulcanized rubber?

A nanometre-scale pore connects the two parts of the cell for the transport of liquid, ions, and analyte molecules. Since the pore is so small - diameters range from 1 to about 100 nm - it typically represents the largest source of resistance in the cell (M\u03a9 to G\u03a9). Application of a bias voltage between the two electrodes results in an ion current through the cell, which to a first approximation depends on the dimensions of the pore; the bias voltage applied; and the conductivity of the electrolyte. Transport of, say DNA through the pore (\u201ctranslocation\u201d), changes the pore conductance and hence the ion current - which can be detected with fast low-current detection electronics. The duration, magnitude and details of the modulation event may then be related back to the identity of the analyte molecule. For example, the longer the DNA, the longer the translocation event; the larger its magnitude, the larger the relative pore volume temporarily blocked by the DNA; the more feature-rich the current modulation, the more complex the structure of the analyte (e.g. due to specific binding of proteins to the DNA) and so forth", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "12", "title": "Electrochemistry: Volume 12", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Tim Albrecht"}, {"name": "Marco Carminati"}, {"name": "Giorgio Ferrari"}, {"name": "Philippa Nuttall"}, {"name": "William Pitchford"}, {"name": "Agnieszka J.

The NR plantation industry has evolved over the years from a largely agricultural based product to that of a technically specified industrial feedstock producer that supports a multitude of industries on rubber products for diverse applications. So far NR is the only successful commercial source of technical elastomer extracted from nature. The rest of the elastomers are manufactured from monomers obtained from crude oil. The major NR producing countries are concentrated in South-East Asia and south Asia, producing more than 80% of the world's NR in their smallholdings and well-managed plantations. In this chapter a brief history of the development of the Hevea NR industry will be described and contrasted with that of the synthetic rubbers. The latex collected from the trees is a colloidal dispersion containing rubber hydrocarbon particles in addition to non-rubbers of biological origin. The colloidal properties of the NR latex and how its stability and preservation is affected by the biological components of the latex will be highlighted. The methods of purification and concentration of field latex into technically specified latex for the dipping industry are elaborated. Solid rubbers are produced from field latex or from a blend of latex and collected field coagula. Depending on the cleanliness of the source materials, different grades of crepe rubbers, sheet rubbers and block rubbers are produced. More than 80% of NR produced is block rubbers which are technically specified (TSR) as opposed to the visually graded sheet and crepe rubbers. The acceptance of these technically specified rubbers as standard rubbers for the global market on par with the synthetics is clear proof of their quality. Special grades of latices and rubbers including those chemically modified such as epoxidized NR (ENR) are produced to meet special product or processing needs. Some recent advances in addressing the rubber protein allergy issue in medical gloves, in searching for benign, safe, hazard-free accelerators and preservatives for latex; and measures in addressing the nitrosamines in rubber products will be dealt with in some detail. The diverse applications of latex and solid rubbers are also covered, highlighting some niche application areas where NR excels over the synthetics.

This concept, which has often resurfaced in works by Negri, Spivak, Virno and numerous other contemporary thinkers, has a long prehistory in the work of Marx and subsequent Marxist theorists, perhaps most importantly in the work of Uno K\u014dz\u014d, arguably the most influential and widely known Marxist thinker in modern Japan. Uno\u2019s work, and particularly his major theoretical works of the 1950s, developed an entire logical analysis of the peculiar position of the labour-power commodity within capital\u2019s drive, noting that this site marks the place wherein capital\u2019s logical interior and its historical exterior interpenetrate each other, generating a volatile force of excess at the core of capital\u2019s supposedly smooth and pure circuit-process. By developing around this point an extensive theoretical discussion of its dynamics of impossibility or irrationality, centred on a term \u2013 muri \u2013 that he raises to the level of a concept, Uno formulates a series of original theses in methodology, on the concept of population, and particularly around the figures of the logical and the historical in the critical analysis of capitalism. Focusing in particular on this \u2018impossibility\u2019 or muri that is nevertheless constantly \u2018passing through\u2019 the capital-relation, this essay investigates the entire range of Uno\u2019s analysis, revealing not only a crucial thread of theoretical inquiry that remains contemporary for us today, but also another set of possibilities linking the critique of political economy to the renewal of revolutionary politics.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "21", "title": "Historical Materialism", "corpusName": "brill-journals"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Gavin Walker"}], "KeyWords": ["Absent", "Body", "Labour", "Power:", "Uno", "K\u014dz\u014d\u2019s", "Logic", "Capital"]},

Diego La\u00ednez made the most important decision in 1560 when he ordered that all Jesuits would teach. The goal of Jesuit teaching went beyond saving souls: Jesuit schools had the secular purpose of improving civil society by educating boys to earn a living and to fill leadership positions. Much recent scholarship has focused on Jesuit mathematical scholarship and teaching while insufficient attention has been devoted to philosophy. The Jesuits oversaw and taught in boarding schools for noble boys with considerable success. However, their attempts to become professors in universities often met with strong resistance and sometimes failed. The Jesuits devoted considerable time and effort to catechetical instruction using a variety of catechisms and approaches across Europe and the rest of the world. A major scholarly lacuna is the lack of attention paid to the financing of Jesuit colleges and schools, largely because of its complexity. A mix of subsidies from ruler or city council, designated taxes, private bequests of property or income, donations, living annuities, and other devices supported Jesuit schools.

The use of high-energy radiation using electron beam (EB) accelerators has been well established for crosslinking of polymers as it results in a product that offers distinct advantages over chemically crosslinked polymeric materials.

The reservoir of naturally occurring glyco-structures is incredibly large and involves a tremendous number of carbohydrate-active enzymes (more than 280,000 released modules in the Carbohydrate Active enZymes database) for their synthesis and degradation. Nevertheless, natural enzymes do not necessarily present all the requested properties in terms of efficiency, specificity or stability when considering their usage for carbohydrate or glyco-derivative manufacturing. In addition, if existing, the identification of an enzyme perfectly adapted to a specific function from the natural diversity may be critical due to the lack of available biochemical data and may necessitate intensive screening efforts. To circumvent such limitations and provide optimized solutions, protein engineering has been considered. Leloir-type glycosyltransferases, for example, are mainly involved in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates in Nature and they have been widely studied and engineered for this purpose. However, these enzymes are often found as membrane-bound proteins, what renders difficult their isolation and purification. In addition, their need of low-abundant activated sugars as glycosyl donors also impairs their usage. Alternatively, enzymes that use more abundant glycosyl donor directly issued from agro-ressources have been considered to access to new glyco-derivatives. This has promoted the use of glucansucrases (GS) that catalyze transglycosylation reactions from sucrose substrate. These enzymes are of particular interest for synthetic purpose and have found industrial interest for pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications. To diversify their applications, various approaches of engineering have been exploited to improve expression level, stability, or change substrate or product specificity of these enzymes. In particular, the range of molecules recognized and the osidic linkages formed by GS is broad but yet limited. Therefore, protein engineering methods have been applied to further increase the diversity of glycosylation reactions catalyzed by these enzymes. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis experiments have enabled the identification of key amino acid residues of glucansucrases either involved in catalysis or substrate specificity. Moreover, the determination of three-dimensional structures of glucansucrases from both families 13 and 70 of Glycoside-Hydrolases (GH) have provided powerful information for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships and guiding structure-based rational and semi-rational engineering of these proteins. To assist these efforts, high-throughput screening and biomolecular methods have been developed for the directed evolution of these enzymes. Here are reported some of the successes in the bioengineering of glucansucrases from precursor work to latest results, as well as the methods developed for screening and developing efficient variant libraries.

For example, the UV bands of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) and poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (PEA) shifts than that polymer alone were confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy due to its etherification reaction between OH groups formed in situ during melt blending ENR and \u2013COOH groups of PEA.

They include lowering the production cost, enhancement of the mechanical and physical properties and the ease of processing. It is widely known that natural rubber exhibits both viscous and elastic behaviour. The difficulty of fabrication of natural rubber is the big deal in the rubber processing industries. In fact, the flow of natural rubber is significantly affected by various factors such as processing time, temperature, applied stress and strain. Furthermore, processability property of natural rubber is also clearly based on types of natural rubber. Therefore, premasticated natural rubber to achieve the appropriate viscosity is necessary for blends of natural rubber with other polymers. In this chapter, the rheological behaviour in terms of processability and melt rheology with respect to tan\u00a0\u03b4, Mooney viscosity, shear stress and shear viscosity at various shear rates for natural rubber blended with various types of polymer is considered. The chapter is described in the category that is classified into three topics including the rheological behaviour of natural rubber blended with thermoplastics, the rheological behaviour of natural rubber blended with synthetic rubbers and the rheological behaviour of chemically modified natural rubber blended with various types of polymer.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "1", "title": "Natural Rubber Materials: Volume 1: Blends and IPNs", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Ploenpit Boochathum"}], "KeyWords": ["CHAPTER", "18", "-", "Rheological", "Behaviour", "Natural", "Rubber", "Based", "Blends"]},

MgO samples stabilized at different temperatures were used to control the distribution of surface base sites; specifically, MgO was calcined at 673 K, 773 K and 873 K (samples MgO-673, MgO-773 and MgO-873). The nature, density and strength of MgO base sites were characterized by temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 and infrared spectroscopy after CO2 adsorption at 298 K and sequential evacuation at increasing temperatures. MgO samples contained surface sites of strong (low coordination O2\u2212 anions), medium (oxygen in Mg2+-O2\u2212 pairs) and weak (OH\u2212 groups) basicity. The density of strong basic sites was predominant on MgO-673. The increase of the calcination temperature drastically decreased the density of strong base sites and to a lesser extent that of weak OH\u2212 groups, while slightly increased that of medium-strength base sites. The catalytic properties of MgO samples were proved for the aldol condensation of citral with acetone to yieldpseudoionone, the hydrogen transfer reaction of mesityl oxide with 2-propanol to obtain the unsaturated alcohol 4-methyl-3-penten-2ol, and the synthesis of monoglycerides via the transesterification of methyl oleate with glycerol. The effect of calcination temperature on the MgO catalytic properties depended on the basicity requirements for the rate-limiting step of the base-catalyzed reaction. The activity for both the aldol condensation of citral with acetone and the glycerolysis of methyl oleate diminished with the MgO calcination temperature because these reactions were essentially promoted on strongly basic O2\u2212 sites. In contrast, the synthesis of 4-methyl-3-penten-2ol by the hydrogen transfer reduction of mesityl oxide with 2-propanol increased with calcination temperature because the reaction intermediate was formed on medium-strength Mg2+-O2\u2212 pair basic sites. Additional information on the role played by the MgO active sites on the kinetics of base-catalyzed reactions was obtained by performing molecular modeling studies on our MgO catalysts using Density Functional Theory (DFT) for the glycerolysis of methyl oleate, an unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The molecular modeling of glycerol and FAME adsorptions was carried out using terrace, edge and corner sites for representing the MgO (100) surface. In agreement with catalytic results, calculations predicted that dissociative chemisorption of glycerol with O\u2013H bond breaking occurs only on strong base sites (edge sites) whereas nondissociative adsorption takes place on medium-strength base sites such as those of terrace sites. Results also indicated that glycerol was more strongly adsorbed than FAME. The glycerol/FAME reaction would proceed then through a mechanism in which the most relevant adsorption step is that of glycerol.", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "26", "title": "Catalysis: Volume 26", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "J.

Beyond the well-knownpseudo-rotational analysis based on two parameters, puckering angle and amplitude, we present a complementary and new approach to describe ring conformational dynamics which is better able to describe unsymmetrical conformations that are lost bypseudo-rotational analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the endocyclic dihedral angles proved to be an efficient method to describe collective, global motions of the carbohydrate ring, with two or three principal components containing the largest mean-square fluctuation. Our ring dihedral principal component analysis model (RdPCA) describes ring conformational dynamics based on inherent ring motions rather than arbitrarily restrictive descriptors. RdPCA analysis of both classical and full quantum mechanical molecular dynamics indicates that furanosides have dominant minimum energy conformations but are rather flexible within these conformers, showing broad wells from a thermodynamic point of view. This RdPCA model also gave indications on the kinetic behaviour of such systems suggesting possible energy pathways for ring motions on the energy landscape.

Raman spectroscopy has been applied on roadside soils and plants and on buildings facades in order to detect traffic emitted compounds. The emission of particles by diesel engines is another important field of study regarding to the air pollution in urban areas. In this sense, apart from Raman spectroscopy, the use of scanning electron microscopy coupled to Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) plays an important role. In the literature appear several works which focus on the analysis of road dust; particles emitted by brake and tire wear are characterised by SEM images together with X-ray absorption spectra (EDS).", "source": ["Istex"], "host": {"volume": "45", "title": "Spectroscopic Properties of Inorganic and Organometallic Compounds: Volume 45", "corpusName": "rsc-ebooks"}, "publicationDate": "2014", "authors": [{"name": "Jose Antonio Carrero"}, {"name": "Gorka Arana"}, {"name": "Juan Manuel Madariaga"}], "KeyWords": ["Chapter", "6", "-", "Use", "Raman", "spectroscopy", "scanning", "electron", "microscopy", "detection", "analysis", "road", "transport", "pollution"]}]
