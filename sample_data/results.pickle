VGender dependent EEG-changes during a mental rotation task __ This study is based on 30 students, 15 females and 15 males. EEG was recorded with 19 electrodes according to the international 10/20 system against averaged signals picked up from both ear lobes. Averaged power spectra and cross-power spectra between all electrode-positions were computed. Data were reduced to five frequency bands (theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2) and finally mean amplitude and coherence were computed. EEG-recordings were made during a mental rotation task (Shepard-figures). The obtained spectral parameters were compared with the corresponding values of a baseline activity with eyes open at rest. The results of statistical evaluations (paired Wilcoxon tests, Wilcoxon tests of independent samples) were presented in error probability maps. In males, local coherence decreased between the posterior left electrodes in the theta-band. In females, a decrease of coherence between the posterior right electrodes were observed in this frequency-band. In contrast to females, males showed an increase of coherence between frontal, central and parietal electrode positions in both hemispheres in the alpha1-band. The increase of local coherence in the beta1-band over the right temporo-parietal sites in the male group was more pronounced than in the female group. Especially in females, interhemispheric coherence increased between the posterior electrodes in the theta-, beta1- and beta2-ranges. This study suggests the involvement of many brain areas during mental rotation. Females show a rather symmetrical allocation of coherence increase in theta, beta1 and beta2.

VA new approach to examine conformational changes occurring upon binding of ligand by biomolecules __ Liquid-liquid partition chromatography in an aqueous poly(ethylene glycol)/dextran two-phase system (LLPC) is shown to be a quick and sensitive method for detecting conformational changes occurring upon binding of ligands by biospecific molecules. Two groups of well-characterized proteins, enzymes and monoclonal antibodies, were employed. As an example, LLPC demonstrated that isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase as well as of hexokinase existed in a ligand-dependent equilibrium between two forms and that conformational changes occurred when monoclonal antibodies bound haptens. We also demonstrate that the method could be used to detect and separate subfractions in preparations of unliganded proteins that appeared to be homogeneous when analysed by other techniques.

VThe impact of higher education on entrepreneurial intentions of university students in China __ Purpose The aim of this article is to investigate the relationship between Chinese university students' higher educational background and their entrepreneurial intentions. Designmethodologyapproach The TPB model was adopted and tested for the formation of Chinese university students' entrepreneurial intentions using structural equation modeling. Data were collected from students of Tongji University in Shanghai, China. Findings The main results of this empirical research suggest that diversity of educational background offers plausible explanations on the difference of entrepreneurial intentions of Chinese university students. Higher educational institutions should develop more flexible approaches with focus on different groups of students in accordance with their various educational backgrounds. Practical implications In response to the change of graduate labour market and the quest for sustainable competitive advantage in China, higher educational institutions have to integrate the change of mindset, skills and abilities about entrepreneurship in their general academic education in order to nurture university students' entrepreneurial intentions in China. Originalityvalue The paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence about the impact of higher education on entrepreneurial intentions of university students in mainland China and thus fills an important gap in the entrepreneurship literature.

VDevelopment of digestive tract and proteolytic enzyme activity in seabass ( Lates calcarifer ) larvae and juveniles __ The development of the digestive tract and changes in activity of proteolytic enzymes were studied in seabass larvae and juveniles. The stomach and pyloric sphincter did not start to be formed until 13 days after hatching (day 13) and were not completely formed until day 17. Prior to this, a high level of pinocytotic activity was found in the rectal cells of 6-day-old and 14-day-old seabass larvae indicating that protein macromolecules were being absorbed by these cells.The pH of the anterior gut (the presumptive stomach before the stomach was formed) in early larvae was alkaline (pH 7.7 on day 8); on day 17, the pH of the stomach had become acidic (pH 5.0) and pepsin-type enzyme activity in the larvae had increased from an initial basal level. By day 22, the acidity of the stomach had become more pronounced (pH 3.7) and the pepsin-type enzyme activity had become well established. Digestion of dietary proteins bv the larvae and the possible contribution of live food to the process are discussed.

VTwo- and three-electrode impedance studies on 18650 Li-ion cells __ Two- and three-electrode impedance measurements were made on 18650 Li-ion cells at different temperatures ranging from 35°C to \u221240°C. The ohmic resistance of the cell is nearly constant in the temperature range studied although the total cell impedance increases by an order of magnitude in the same temperature range. In contrast to what is commonly believed, we show from our three-electrode impedance results that, the increase in cell impedance comes mostly from the cathode and not from the anode. Further, the anode and cathode contribute to both the impedance loops (in the NyQuist plot).

VAnnotation-based distance measures for patient subgroup discovery in clinical microarray studies __ Motivation: Clustering algorithms are widely used in the analysis of microarray data. In clinical studies, they are often applied to find groups of co-regulated genes. Clustering, however, can also stratify patients by similarity of their gene expression profiles, thereby defining novel disease entities based on molecular characteristics. Several distance-based cluster algorithms have been suggested, but little attention has been given to the distance measure between patients. Even with the Euclidean metric, including and excluding genes from the analysis leads to different distances between the same objects, and consequently different clustering results. Results: We describe a new clustering algorithm, in which gene selection is used to derive biologically meaningful clusterings of samples by combining expression profiles and functional annotation data. According to gene annotations, candidate gene sets with specific functional characterizations are generated. Each set defines a different distance measure between patients, leading to different clusterings. These clusterings are filtered using a resampling-based significance measure. Significant clusterings are reported together with the underlying gene sets and their functional definition. Conclusions: Our method reports clusterings defined by biologically focused sets of genes. In annotation-driven clusterings, we have recovered clinically relevant patient subgroups through biologically plausible sets of genes as well as new subgroupings. We conjecture that our method has the potential to reveal so far unknown, clinically relevant classes of patients in an unsupervised manner.

VNeutrophils enhance invasion activity of human cholangiocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells: An in vitro study __ Background and Aim:\u2002 Tumor\u2013mesenchymal interactions are involved in the mechanism of tumor invasion in several types of carcinoma. Mutual interactions between carcinoma cells and neutrophils, however, have been poorly understood. In the present study we examined the effect of neutrophils on invasion activities of carcinoma cells in vitro. Role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a mediator was also evaluated. Methods:\u2002 Using a Matrigel invasion chamber, invasion activities of HuCC\u2010T1 human cholangiocellular carcinoma cells and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells in response to recombinant HGF or neutrophils were evaluated. Results:\u2002 Recombinant HGF dose\u2010dependently increased invasion activities of HuCC\u2010T1 and HepG2 cells. Neutrophils significantly enhanced invasion activities of these cells, which were suppressed to the respective basal levels with anti\u2010HGF antibody. The carcinoma cells did not secrete HGF. Neutrophils cultivated in tumor condition medium (TCM) of HuCC\u2010T1 or HepG2 cells secreted a significant level of HGF protein without increasing HGF mRNA expression. Treatment with heat or ultrafiltration of TCM of HuCC\u2010T1 or HepG2 cells suggested carcinoma cell\u2010derived HGF inducer(s) to be certain protein(s) with a molecular weight of more than 30\u2003000. Conclusions:\u2002 The present study suggests the presence of mutual interactions between HuCC\u2010T1/HepG2 carcinoma cells and neutrophils in tumor invasion via paracrine regulation mediated by neutrophil\u2010derived HGF.

VFinding Regularity: Describing and Analysing Circuits That Are Not Quite Regular __ Abstract: We demonstrate some simple but powerful methods that ease the problem of describing and generating circuits that exhibit a degree of regularity, but are not as beautifully regular as the text-book examples. Our motivating example is not a circuit, but a piece of C code that is widely used in graphics applications. It is a sequence of compare-and-swap operations that computes the median of 25 inputs. We use the example to illustrate a set of circuit design methods that aid in the writing of sophisticated circuit generators.

VFunctional organization of activation patterns in children: Whole brain fMRI imaging during three different cognitive tasks __ 1. 1. Patterns of brain activation were measured with whole brain echo-planar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3.0 Tesla in healthy children (N = 6) and in one child with a left- hemisphere encephalomalacic lesion as sequellae from early stroke. 2. 2. Three cognitive tasks were used: auditory sentence comprehension, verb generation to line drawings, and mental rotation of alphanumeric stimuli. 3. 3. There was evidence for significant bilateral activation m all three cognitive tasks for the healthy children. Their patterns of activation were consistent with previous functional imaging studies with adults. 4. 4. The child with a left-hemisphere stroke showed evidence of homologous organization in the non- damaged hemisphere.

VElectrochemistry of copper activation of sphalerite at pH 9.2 __ The mechanism of copper-activation of sphalerite was studied at pH 9.2. The study was conducted using a carbon matrix composite (CMC) electrode containing sphalerite particles. Rest potential measurement and voltammetry experiments conducted on the CMC electrodes showed that a CuS-like activation product was formed when the electrode was activated in 10\u22124 M CuSO4 solutions at open circuit. When the electrode was activated at lower potentials, a Cu2S-like activation product was formed. Sphalerite activated under slightly oxidizing conditions produced hydrophobic species on the surface, possibly copper polysulfides.

VHemispheric lateralisation in a manual\u2013verbal task combination: the role of modality and gender __ Differences in hemispheric lateralisation between males and females were tested using a manual\u2013verbal task combination. The manual task was finger tapping and the verbal task required reciting words. Words were presented either visually or aurally in order to examine a possible role of modality of presentation on hemispheric lateralisation. The influence of the verbal task on motor task performance was evaluated by changes in the number of taps from single to dual-task condition. The influence of the motor task performance on the verbal task was examined by changes in the number of words recalled. Cognitive performance differences between males and females were also examined in a mental rotation task. The results showed a greater right finger (RH) tapping than left finger (LH) tapping interference, but only when the verbal task was presented in the visual mode. There was no difference in this pattern between males and females, both showing a greater RH tapping than LH tapping interference. The interference in finger tapping for both RH and LH was greater when the verbal task was presented aurally than when presented visually. Furthermore, females compared to males showed a greater interference in finger tapping when the verbal task was presented aurally than when presented visually. Later recall of verbal information was impaired equally by concurrent RH or LH tapping; however, later recall was better when the verbal task was presented visually than when presented aurally. No gender differences were found in delayed recall. Performance in the mental rotation task was better in males than in females. The data are discussed on the basis of theories of dual task interference and/or of brain asymmetry.

VMaintaining evaluation designs in long term community based health promotion programmes: Heartbeat Wales case study. __ STUDY OBJECTIVE--To examine the difficulties of developing and maintaining outcome evaluation designs in long term, community based health promotion programmes. DESIGN--Semistructured interviews of health promotion managers. SETTING--Wales and two reference health regions in England. PARTICIPANTS--Nine health promotion managers in Wales and 18 in England. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Information on selected heart health promotion activity undertaken or coordinated by health authorities from 1985-90 was collected. The Heartbeat Wales coronary heart disease prevention programme was set up in 1985, and a research and evaluation strategy was established to complement the intervention. A substantial increase in the budget occurred over the period. In the reference health regions in England this initiative was noted and rapidly taken up, thus compromising their use as control areas. CONCLUSION--Information on large scale, community based health promotion programmes can disseminate quickly and interfere with classic intervention/evaluation control designs through contamination. Alternative experimental designs for assessing the effectiveness of long term intervention programmes need to be considered. These should not rely solely on the use of reference populations, but should balance the measurement of outcome with an assessment of the process of change in communities. The development and use of intervention exposure measures together with well structured and comprehensive process evaluation in both the intervention and reference areas is recommended.

VSex differences in visual spatial ability in 9-year-old children __ Sex differences in spatial ability have not been reliably demonstrated in prepubertal children. This could in part be due to the lack of age-appropriate and reliable tests. In this study, adult versions of multiple-choice tests measuring three different spatial ability categories were adapted for use with 9-year-old children. Sex differences of 0.6 to 0.8 and 0.4 standard deviation units were found in mental rotation and spatial perception, respectively, indicating that reliable sex differences in spatial ability are present in prepubertal children. A small (0.2) and nonsignificant difference appeared in spatial visualization. These effect sizes and their distribution across categories are similar to meta-analytic results based on adolescent and adult data. Analyses of test intercorrelations showed that the shared variance among tests was higher in boys than in girls, suggesting that spatial ability is a more unified trait in boys as compared to girls, in whom spatial abilities are more heterogeneously organized.

VThe effect of gravity on human recognition of disoriented objects __ The role of non-visual cues, and particularly of signals tied to the direction of gravity, in the mechanisms of recognition of disoriented objects is reviewed. In spite of a limited number of studies, object recognition does not seem dramatically altered by weightlessness and astronauts can adapt to this novel environment. Particularly, mental rotation strategy can still be used in weightlessness with dynamic parameters relatively unchanged. Similarly, spatial coordinate assignment can be performed adequately under different gravitational conditions. However, signals related to gravity direction seem to be integrated in the early stages of visual processing. Thus, performances in symmetry detection tasks and visual search tasks are influenced by the gravito-inertial conditions in which experience are done. Functional roles of such a multisensory convergence on cortical visual neurons, partly confirmed by neurophysiological studies, are proposed.

VDevelopment of visual cognition: Transfer effects of the Agam program __ The Agam program was designed to foster visual thinking in young children by developing their visual language. This curriculum was implemented in five nursery classes for 2 consecutive school years. Children in these classes were compared with children in classes where the program was not administered. It was hypothesized that the generative nature of the visual language developed in the experimental children would allow the children to extend the language learned to new situations and help them to solve problems in which no prior training was given. Test results confirmed this hypothesis: The effects of training in the Agam program transferred to cognitive domains in which no training was given. Specifically, the findings indicated positive effects on general intelligence and school readiness of children about to enter first grade, with especially pronounced effects in the areas of arithmetic and writing readiness. Other findings revealed an increased visual learning ability in new tasks that developed in the experimental children. Training effects did not transfer to mental rotation and to memory for realistic designs. The program was found to be equally effective for lower-class as for middle-class children. The effect of the program was greater for children who participated in the program for 2 years as compared with those who joined in the second year, indicating a cumulative effect of the program. This latter finding can also be used to refute an alternative explanation of the obtained experimental effects offered by a motivational theory. The findings on cognitive transfer, taken together with previously reported on concept learning and visual skills, point to the educational potential of the approach advocated by the Agam program, that is, systematic long-term instruction in the domain of visual cognition in early childhood.

VAn optimal state-age dependent replacement for a network system __ We consider an optimal state-age dependent replacement problem for a network system composed of a main system and a sub-system with N components. The component's functioning times are exponentially distributed random variables with the same parameters, and every failed component is repaired by one repairman by taking an exponentially distributed random time. Repaired components are as good as new. The main system is subject to a sequence of randomly occurring shocks and each shock causes a random amount og damage. Shock arrivals and magnitudes depend on the accumulated damage level of the main system itself and the number of the functioning components of the sub-system. Any of the shocks or component's failures might cause the main system to fail. Upon failure of the main system, it is replaced and emergency repairs for all failed components are carried out. Our aim is to determine an optimal state-age dependent replacement policy which minimizes the long-run average cost over the infinite horizon.

VReimmunization after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation __ Allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients are severely immunocompromised during the immediate posttransplant period, and the risk for common and opportunistic infections may persist for many months. The role of reimmunization for these patients, however, remains unsettled. We briefly review current concepts regarding the recapitulation of immunity from the totipotential hematopoietic stem cells in the donor marrow. The fact that various components of the new immune system mature at different rates can have clinical consequences with regard to specific infections.Most previously immunized patients become antibody seronegative within a few months after allogeneic marrow transplantation. Adoptive transfer of specific antibody-producing cells from the donor to the recipient has been demonstrated in small clinical trials, and is augmented when both donor and recipient are vaccinated. Passive transfer of immunity is more easily achieved to recall antigens than to neoantigens. Primary immunization requires prolonged antigenic stimulation and mature T-cell function or help from natural killer cells. Most healthy patients generate adequate antibody titers to vaccinations that are given 12 months after transplantation, but the presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease can diminish the response.Currently available vaccines have been evaluated in marrow transplant patients. Protein antigens such as tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are more immunogenic than polysaccharide antigens such as pneumococcal vaccine. The new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines, such as the Hemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, also appear more immunogenic. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine has been used successfully. Relatively few data are available about hepatitis B or influenza vaccines.The literature supports the use of standard vaccines in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients. However, more data on the optimal methods and timing of immunization are needed. We present guidelines for a reimmunization schedule.

VHuman hippocampus and viewpoint dependence in spatial memory __ Virtual reality was used to sequentially present objects within a town square and to test recognition of object locations from the same viewpoint as presentation, or from a shifted viewpoint. A developmental amnesic case with focal bilateral hippocampal pathology showed a massive additional impairment when tested from the shifted viewpoint compared with a mild, list length\u2010dependent, impairment when tested from the same viewpoint. While the same\u2010view condition could be solved by visual pattern matching, the shifted\u2010view condition requires a viewpoint independent representation or an equivalent mechanism for translating or rotating viewpoints in memory. The latter mechanism was indicated by control subjects' response latencies in the shifted\u2010view condition, although the amnesic case is not impaired in tests of mental rotation of single objects. These results show that the human hippocampus supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory, and suggest that it does so by providing a mechanism for viewpoint manipulation in memory. In addition, they suggest an extremely sensitive test for human hippocampal damage, and hint at the nature of the hipppocampal role in episodic recollection.

VMental motor imagery indexes pain: The hand laterality task __ Mental motor imagery is subserved by the same cognitive systems that underlie action. In turn, action is informed by the anticipated sensory consequences of movement, including pain. In light of these considerations, one would predict that motor imagery would provide a useful measure pain\u2010related functional interference. We report a study in which 19 patients with chronic musculoskeletal or radiculopathic arm or shoulder pain, 24 subjects with chronic pain not involving the arm/shoulder and 41 normal controls were asked to indicate if a line drawing was a right or left hand. Previous work demonstrated that this task is performed by mental rotation of the subject's hand to match the stimulus. Relative to normal and pain control subjects, arm/shoulder pain subjects were significantly slower for stimuli that required greater amplitude rotations. For the arm/shoulder pain subjects only there was a correlation between degree of slowing and the rating of severity of pain with movement but not the non\u2010specific pain rating. The hand laterality task may supplement the assessment of subjects with chronic arm/shoulder pain.

VAtypical Visuospatial Processing in Autism: Insights from Functional Connectivity Analysis __ Atypical visuospatial processing is commonly described in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however the specific neurobiological underpinnings of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Given the extensive evidence suggesting ASDs are characterized by abnormal neural connectivity, this study aimed to investigate network connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD. Twenty\u2010two males with ASD without intellectual disability and 22 individually matched controls performed a mental rotation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in which two rotated stimuli were judged to be same (\u201cSame Trials\u201d) or mirror\u2010imaged (\u201cMirror Trials\u201d). Behavioral results revealed a relative advantage of mental rotation in the ASD group\u2014controls were slower responding to the more difficult Mirror Trials than Same Trials whereas the ASD group completed Mirror Trials and Same\u2010trials at similar speeds. In the ASD group, brain activity was reduced in frontal, temporal, occipital, striatal, and cerebellar regions and, consistent with previous literature, functional connectivity between a number of brain regions was reduced. However, some connections appeared to be conserved and were recruited in a qualitatively different way by the two groups. As task difficulty increased (on Mirror Trials), controls tended to increase connections between certain brain regions, whereas the ASD group appeared to suppress connections between these regions. There was an interesting exception to this pattern in the visual cortex, a finding that may suggest an advantage in early visual perceptual processing in ASD. Overall, this study has identified a relative advantage in mental rotation in ASD that is associated with aberrant neural connectivity and that may stem from enhanced visual perceptual processing.

VMental rotation delays the heart beat: Probing the central processing bottleneck __ We tested the hypothesis that mental rotation would delay response\u2010related processing as indicated by transient slowing of the heart beat. Thirty college\u2010age subjects (half female) were presented with normal and mirror image letters rotated at 0, 60, 120, and 180°. Three letters were assigned to a right\u2010hand response; a separate three to a left\u2010hand response. Responses were only required for letters in one orientation, mirror or normal. Continuous measures of interbeat interval (IBI) of the heart, respiration, and muscle tension were collected. Performance results were largely consistent with prior findings. Greater angular displacement of the stimuli was associated with greater lengthening of IBI immediately after the stimulus. IBI was influenced equally by angle of rotation in respond and inhibit trials. The lengthening of IBI was interpreted as due to a delay in response selection and execution due to mental rotation.

VSecond generation bioenergy crops and climate change: a review of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and drought on water use and the implications for yield __ Second\u2010generation, dedicated lignocellulosic crops for bioenergy are being hailed as the sustainable alternative to food crops for the generation of liquid transport fuels, contributing to climate change mitigation and increased energy security. Across temperate regions they include tree species grown as short rotation coppice and intensive forestry (e.g. Populus and Salix species) and C4 grasses such as miscanthus and switchgrass. For bioenergy crops it is paramount that high energy yields are maintained in order to drive the industry to an economic threshold where it has competitive advantage over conventional fossil fuel alternatives. Therefore, in the face of increased planting of these species, globally, there is a pressing need for insight into their responses to predicted changes in climate to ensure these crops are \u2018climate proofed\u2019 in breeding and improvement programmes. In this review, we investigate the physiological responses of bioenergy crops to rising atmospheric CO2 ([Ca]) and drought, with particular emphasis on the C3Salicaceae trees and C4 grasses. We show that while crop yield is predicted to rise by up to 40% in elevated [Ca], this is tempered by the effects of water deficit. In response to elevated [Ca] stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration decline and higher leaf\u2013water potentials are observed. However, whole\u2010plant responses to [Ca] are often of lower magnitude and may even be positive (increased water use in elevated [Ca]). We conclude that rising [Ca] is likely to improve drought tolerance of bioenergy crop species due to improved plant water use, consequently yields in temperate environments may remain high in future climate scenarios.

VCytomegalovirus MHC class I homologues and natural killer cells: an overview __ Viruses that establish a persistent infection with their host have evolved numerous strategies to evade the immune system. Consequently, they are useful tools to dissect the complex cellular processes that comprise the immune response. Rapid progress has been made in recent years in defining the role of cellular MHC class I molecules in regulating the response of natural killer (NK) cells. Concomitantly, the roles of the MHC class I homologues encoded by human and mouse cytomegaloviruses in evading or subverting NK cell responses has received considerable interest. This review discusses the results from a number of studies that have pursued the biological function of the viral MHC class I homologues. Based on the evidence from these studies, hypotheses for the possible role of these intriguing molecules are presented.

VChromosomal abnormalities of 200 Chinese patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Taiwan: with special reference to T-cell lymphoma __ Background: The distribution of the histopathological subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is different among various geographical areas. However, there are few reports concerning cytogenetic findings of NHL, especially T-cell lymphoma, in Asian people. Patients and methods: We analyzed the chromosomal abnormalities of 200 adult patients with NHL in Taiwan and correlated the non-random aberrations with the histological subtypes. Results: One hundred and thirty-eight patients (69%) had B-cell lymphoma. The incidence of the t(14;18) in total lymphoma was lower in Taiwan (12%) than in the West (20\u201330%), but its incidence in follicular lymphoma was comparable between the two areas (17 of 28 patients, 61% versus \u223c50\u201360%). Sixty-two patients (31%) had T-cell lymphoma, including 11 angiocentric T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma and only two angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILD). The recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in T-cell lymphoma comprised 6q deletion (30%), 11q deletion (20%), 17p deletion (16%), \u221217 (16%), \u2013Y (14%) and\u2009+\u20098 (11%). Angiocentric T/NK-cell lymphoma had a significantly higher frequency of 1q duplication (P=0.001), 6p duplication (P\u2009<0.001) and 11q deletion (P=0.011) than other T-cell lymphoma. The incidences of +3 and +5, two common abnormalities in AILD, were quite low in T-cell lymphoma in Taiwan (4% and 2%, respectively), compared with those in the West (16\u201332% and \u223c15%, respectively). The 11q deletion, not a common aberration in T-cell lymphoma in western countries, occurred quite frequently in Taiwan. Conclusions: The chromosomal aberrations of NHL are quite different among various geographical areas, which may reflect the differences in the distribution of the histological subtypes of lymphoma among various areas.

VPalaeomagnetic studies of Proterozoic rocks from the Lake Onega region, southeast Fennoscandian Shield __ In a recent compilation, Elming et al. (1993) presented a new apparent polar wander path for the Proterozoic of the Fennoscandian Shield. However, only a minor portion of the data used for this and for the earlier compilations has been obtained from the eastern part of the Fennoscandian Shield, thus prompting the present study. In this paper we present new palaeomagnetic data for the Lake Onega region. The sections studied comprise quartzites, as well as extrusive and intrusive rocks of Vepsian (1900-1650 Ma) and Jatulian (2300-2100 Ma) ages, which represent Svecofennian and Jatulian tectonomagmatic events respectively. Thermal and alternating-field demagnetization experiments reveal the presence of several components of the natural remanent magnetization of normal and reversed polarity. Component AN has been identified in a sill of Vepsian gabbro-dolerites (1770 Ma) exposed at Rybreka locality and yields a palaeopole at 37.8°N, 210.6°E (dp=4.0°, dm=7.7°). This magnetization is interpreted to be of thermoremanent origin. In the Vepsian Shoksha quartzite (ca. 1800 Ma) cut by the sill and in the underlying basalts, the palaeopoles indicated by the presumably primary components AN and AR are at 45.1 °N, 206.4°E (dp=3.6°, dm=6.5°) and 44.2°N, 241.5°E (dp=6.1°, dm=9.6°) respectively. Component AN was isolated in the Jatulian basaltic lavas (ca 2200-2300 Ma) at Girvas locality also; however in this case it appears as secondary and yields nearly the same palaeopole: 43.1°N, 211.5°E (dp=4.9° dm=8.8°). Component BR was isolated in Vepsian gabbro-dolerites and quartzites, sampled from zones altered by monzonite veins representing the final phase of sill emplacement. This component yields a palaeopole at 13.9°N. 171.3°E (dp=2.4°, dm=4.8°) for gabbro-dolerites and at 10.5°N, 201.8°E (dp=8.4°, dm=14.9°) for quartzites. The Vepsian and Jatulian rocks also show the presence of presumably younger (< 1500 Ma) magnetization components C, D and E. The presumably primary stable dual-polarity components determined in the Jatulian lavas and interlayers of the red siliceous rocks yield a palaeopole at 0.8°S, 245.4°E (dp=7.2°, dm=11.6°) for the upper part of the section (component F) and a palaeopole at 36.0°S, 307.4°E (dp=9.9°, dm=14.9°) for the lower part of the section (component G). These palaeomagnetic poles are compared with the apparent polar wander path of Fennoscandia for the interval 2400-1200 Ma (after Elming et al. 1993) and with some recent results from Vepsian and Jatulian rocks.

VHydrodynamic interaction of a spherical particle with a planar boundary I. Free surface __ We construct the grand resistance and mobility matrices for a hard sphere moving in an incompressible viscous fluid with a planar boundary. Using the result for a single sphere in an unbounded fluid we express the hydrodynamic interaction between the sphere and wall in terms of the Green function for the bounded fluid. We express the resistance and mobility matrices in terms of a set of scalar resistance and mobility functions that depend on the sphere radius and the distance to the boundary. We derive a reflection theorem for a complete set of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and use it to compute a series expansion of the scalar transport functions in inverse powers of the distance to the wall. For the simplest case, a boundary which is a free surface, we give numerical tables of the first twenty expansion coefficients for the functions describing translation and rotation of a sphere with stick boundary conditions.

VA topographic electrophysiologic study of mental rotation __ Mental rotation is a task performed when subjects are requested to determine whether two stimuli presented in turn have the same shape (congruency) or a mirror-image shape (incongruency) regardless of any difference in orientation. We compared event-related potentials during mental rotation tasks with narrow and wide angular disparities between the two stimuli to identify electrophysiologic correlates of mental rotation. When angular disparity was wide, a prominent negative component arose 438 ms after the second stimulus. A statistically significant difference detected between amplitudes of the negative components under narrow- and wide-angle conditions was maximal in the right parietal region, suggesting that processing of mental rotation is a right parietal dominant function.

VBob Kowalski: A Portrait __ Abstract: The hardest part about writing an introductory piece for a celebratory volume such as this is finding the right opening. It has to hit the right tone straight away\u2014affectionate, respectful, but not too sweet and cloying. I had tried and discarded half a dozen attempts when, more in desperation than in any real hope, I turned to technology and typed \u2018Bob Kowalski\u2019 into a WWW search engine. I am not sure what I expected to find. Some previously unpublished tidbit perhaps on which I could build an insightful and original opening. The search yielded a great many results. On page 12 I came across an entry from the newsletter of the Tulsa Thunder, a girls\u2019 football (\u2018soccer\u2019) team in the US. According to one person quoted there: \u201cBob Kowalski was one of the first influential coaches I had. He was an all-round good guy.\u201d I was about to discard this interesting observation (it is a different Bob Kowalski) when it occurred to me that in fact this quotation would serve perfectly as an opening for this piece. I had wanted to begin with remarks about Bob\u2019s inspirational influences and what a good guy he is, but could not decide which should come first. Bob has certainly been one of the most influential coaches I ever had, and as the rest of this volume testifies, an inspirational influence on many, many others too. He is an influential and inspirational coach, and he is an all-round good guy.

VRight-handers and left-handers have different representations of their own hand __ The visual control of our own hand when dealing with an object and the observation of interactions between other people's hand and objects can be involved in the construction of internal representations of our own hand, as well as in hand recognition processes. Therefore, a different effect on handedness recognition is expected when subjects are presented with hands holding objects with either a congruent or an incongruent type of grip. Such an experiment was carried out on right-handed and left-handed subjects. We expected that the different degree of lateralisation in motor activities observed in the two populations [J. Herron, Neuropsychology of left-handedness, Academic Press, New York, 1980.] could account for the construction of different internal hand representations. As previously found [L.M. Parsons, Imaged spatial transformations of one's hands and feet, Cogn. Psychol., 19 (1987) 178\u2013241.], in order to identify handedness, subjects mentally rotated their own hand until it matched with the presented one. This process was confirmatory, being preceded by an implicit visual analysis of the target hand. Presentation of hands holding objects with congruent or incongruent types of grip influenced handedness recognition at different stages in right-handed and left-handed subjects. That is, the mental rotation stage was affected in right-handed subjects, whereas the initial phase of implicit hand analysis was affected in left-handed subjects. We suggest that in handedness recognition, left-handers relied more on a pictorial hand representation, whereas right-handers relied more on a pragmatic hand representation, probably derived from experience in the control of their own movements. The use of different hand representations may be due to differential activation of temporal and premotor areas.

VAre things that are hard to physically move also hard to imagine moving? __ Are objects that are more difficult to physically manipulate also more difficult to mentally manipulate? In our study, participants interacted with wooden objects modeled after the figures from Shepard and Metzler\u2019s (1971) classic mental rotation experiment. One pair of objects was easy to physically rotate while another pair was difficult. They then completed a standard mental rotation task on images of these objects. Participants were slower to mentally rotate objects that were harder to physically rotate when they engaged in motor imagery. Further, this cost accrued with increasing angles of rotation. We verified this was the result of motor imagery by showing that the costs can be eliminated by using a strictly visual imagery strategy (imagining the objects moving on their own). These results reveal a striking constraint imposed by our real-world motor experiences on mental imagery, and also demonstrate a way that we can overcome such constraints.

VPlaying an Action Video Game Reduces Gender Differences in Spatial Cognition __ We demonstrate a previously unknown gender difference in the distribution of spatial attention, a basic capacity that supports higher-level spatial cognition. More remarkably, we found that playing an action video game can virtually eliminate this gender difference in spatial attention and simultaneously decrease the gender disparity in mental rotation ability, a higher-level process in spatial cognition. After only 10 hr of training with an action video game, subjects realized substantial gains in both spatial attention and mental rotation, with women benefiting more than men. Control subjects who played a non-action game showed no improvement. Given that superior spatial skills are important in the mathematical and engineering sciences, these findings have practical implications for attracting men and women to these fields.

VReal Three-Dimensional Objects: Effects on Mental Rotation __ The current experiment investigated real three-dimensional (3D) objects with regard to performance on a mental rotation task and whether the appearance of sex differences may be mediated by experiences with spatially related activities. 40 men and 40 women were presented with alternating timed trials consisting of real-3D objects or two-dimensional illustrations of 3D objects. Sex differences in spatially related activities did not significantly influence the finding that men outperformed women on mental rotation of either stimulus type. However, on measures related to spatial activities, self-reported proficiency using maps correlated positively with performance only on trials with illustrations whereas self-reported proficiency using GPS correlated negatively with performance regardless of stimulus dimensionality. Findings may be interpreted as suggesting that rotating real-3D objects utilizes distinct but overlapping spatial skills compared to rotating two-dimensional representations of 3D objects, and real-3D objects can enhance mental rotation performance.

VThe Effects of Using Google SketchUp on the Mental Rotation Skills of Eighth Grade Students __ The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Google SketchUp, which is a computer aided design (CAD) software, on the Mental Rotation Skills of eighth grade students. For this purpose, in the spring semester of the 2011-2012 academic year, a treatment was conducted with 62 students comprised of 8A and 8B classes in the GSD Education Foundation Bahçelievler Primary School during the six weeks. The study was carried out in accordance with a quasi-experimental research with pretest and posttest design. The "Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test" was used to determine mental rotation skills of the students, participating the research study, as a pretest and posttest. When pretest results examined with independent samples t-test, a significant difference was found in favor of the class 8B (x<sub>8A</sub> = 5.42 x<sub>8B</sub> = 8.45 t(60)=3.62, p&lt;.01). During the four weeks, the students in the control group tried to draw the different view of unit cube models developed by researchers on an isometric paper. In the same duration, the students in the experimental group tried to draw same models with the help of Google SketchUp software. At the end of the four weeks, the Mental Rotation Test was re-conducted for participants as a posttest. Although the increase in the mean scores of mental rotation test is higher in the experimental group, the ANCOVA results revealed that, there is no significant difference between the mean scores of the Mental Rotation Test of the experimental and control groups (F<sub>(1-59)</sub>=.309, p&gt;.05)

VVisual-Spatial Abilities of Pilots __ US Air Force pilots and control Ss participated in 5 experiments, each of which assessed a different type of visual-spatial ability. Although pilots judged metric spatial relations better than did nonpilots, they did not judge categorical spatial relations better than did nonpilots. Pilots mentally rotated objects better than did nonpilots, but pilots did not extrapolate motion, scan images, or extract visual features from objects obscured by visual noise better than did nonpilots. The results imply that efficient use of specific processing subsystems is especially important for, and characteristic of, pilots. The possible neuropsychological bases for the enhanced abilities and their susceptibility to change are discussed.

VConstruction of Test Measuring Mental Rotation Ability of Adolescent High School Students __ One important aspect of Visuospatial Reasoning is the ability to rotate an object mentally. Presently, one of the most popular and widely used test of Mental Rotation is the Redrawn version of Vandenberg & Kuse Mental Rotation test (VMRT) However, this test has often been criticised to be more difficult because of its complicated scoring system. Present study compared this standard test of mental rotation ability with a newly constructed test with less number of items and less complicated scoring system. We collected data from 147 adolescent school students (Mean age=13.10 years; SD=1.84) by administering both the tests consecutively. Findings showed that VMRT has very high difficulty index as compared to the newly constructed test. The latter also proved to be a more reliable and valid measure of mental rotation ability as compared to VMRT. Discussion focused on the relative advantage of the newly constructed test for assessing mental rotation ability.

VSpontaneous gestures during mental rotation tasks: Insights into the microdevelopment of the motor strategy __ This study investigated the motor strategy involved in mental rotation tasks by examining 2 types of spontaneous gestures (hand-object interaction gestures, representing the agentive hand action on an object, vs. object-movement gestures, representing the movement of an object by itself) and different types of verbal descriptions of rotation. Hand-object interaction gestures were produced earlier than object-movement gestures, the rate of both types of gestures decreased, and gestures became more distant from the stimulus object over trials (Experiments 1 and 3). Furthermore, in the first few trials, object-movement gestures increased, whereas hand-object interaction gestures decreased, and this change of motor strategies was also reflected in the type of verbal description of rotation in the concurrent speech (Experiment 2). This change of motor strategies was hampered when gestures were prohibited (Experiment 4). The authors concluded that the motor strategy becomes less dependent on agentive action on the object, and also becomes internalized over the course of the experiment, and that gesture facilitates the former process. When solving a problem regarding the physical world, adults go through developmental processes similar to internalization and symbolic distancing in young children, albeit within a much shorter time span.

VParietal and early visual cortices encode working memory content across mental transformations __ Active and flexible manipulations of memory contents \u201cin the mind's eye\u201d are believed to occur in a dedicated neural workspace, frequently referred to as visual working memory. Such a neural workspace should have two important properties: The ability to store sensory information across delay periods and the ability to flexibly transform sensory information. Here we used a combination of functional MRI and multivariate decoding to indentify such neural representations. Subjects were required to memorize a complex artificial pattern for an extended delay, then rotate the mental image as instructed by a cue and memorize this transformed pattern. We found that patterns of brain activity already in early visual areas and posterior parietal cortex encode not only the initially remembered image, but also the transformed contents after mental rotation. Our results thus suggest that the flexible and general neural workspace supporting visual working memory can be realized within posterior brain regions.

VSpatial Training Improves Children's Mathematics Ability __ We tested whether mental rotation training improved math performance in 6- to 8-year-olds. Children were pretested on a range of number and math skills. Then one group received a single session of mental rotation training using an object completion task that had previously improved spatial ability in children this age (Ehrlich, Levine, & Goldin-Meadow, 2006). The remaining children completed crossword puzzles instead. Children's posttest scores revealed that those in the spatial training group improved significantly on calculation problems. In contrast, children in the control group did not improve on any math tasks. Further analyses revealed that the spatial training group's improvement was largely due to better performance on missing term problems (e.g., 4 + ____ = 11).

VCortical activation during mental rotation in male-to-female and female-to-male transsexuals under hormonal treatment __ There is strong evidence of sex differences in mental rotation tasks. Transsexualism is an extreme gender identity disorder in which individuals seek cross-gender treatment to change their sex. The aim of our study was to investigate if male-to-female (MF) and female-to-male (FM) transsexuals receiving cross-sex hormonal treatment have different patterns of cortical activation during a three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation task. An fMRI study was performed using a 3-T scan in a sample of 18 MF and 19 FM under chronic cross-sex hormonal treatment. Twenty-three males and 19 females served as controls. The general pattern of cerebral activation seen while visualizing the rotated and non-rotated figures was similar for all four groups showing strong occipito-parieto-frontal brain activation. However, compared to control males, the activation of MF transsexuals during the task was lower in the superior parietal lobe. Compared to control females, MF transsexuals showed higher activation in orbital and right dorsolateral prefrontal regions and lower activation in the left prefrontal gyrus. FM transsexuals did not differ from either the MF transsexual or control groups. Regression analyses between cerebral activation and the number of months of hormonal treatment showed a significant negative correlation in parietal, occipital and temporal regions in the MF transsexuals. No significant correlations with time were seen in the FM transsexuals. In conclusion, although we did not find a specific pattern of cerebral activation in the FM transsexuals, we have identified a specific pattern of cerebral activation during a mental 3D rotation task in MF transsexuals under cross-sex hormonal treatment that differed from control males in the parietal region and from control females in the orbital prefrontal region. The hypoactivation in MF transsexuals in the parietal region could be due to the hormonal treatment or could reflect a priori cerebral differences between MF transsexual and control subjects.

VCortical Distribution of Eeg Activity for Component Processes During Mental Rotation __ Alpha power (812 Hz) was monitored over the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes of the left and right cerebral hemispheres while participants mentally rotated three-dimensional shapes to match a specified target. By comparing the activational patterns generated during three experimental conditions, each designed to systematically isolate the involvement of the various subcomponents comprising this mental rotation task, it was suggested that the right frontal lobe mediates encoding and comparison/decision processes, while the left parietal and the left temporal region appear most involved in the generation of images and their mental rotation. A preliminary model describing the cooperative interaction of these cortical regions during mental rotation tasks is proposed.

VThe patterns and costs of services use among homeless families __ This study examines families' use of behavioral health hospitalization and foster care placement before, during, and after shelter use, comparing families based on shelter pattern and type of housing exit. Results show that inpatient and foster care services use drops in the homelessness period, but rebounds after exit, regardless of pattern of shelter use and type of housing exit. Results suggest that shelters supplant use of services, but not on a sustained basis. Despite declines in concurrent services use, the homelessness period is overall more costly for episodically and long\u2010term shelter users, primarily owing to the high costs of shelter. High rates of inpatient and foster care services use after the homeless spell suggest that providers of homeless assistance should systematically screen and refer homeless families to ongoing community\u2010based service supports. Service use patterns indicate that homeless spells may disrupt continuity of care with community\u2010based health and social services. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VThe thermal Aromatization of Methyl\u20101,3\u2010cyclohexadienes \u2013 an important argument against commonly accepted sigmatropic 1,7\u2010H\u2010shift reactions __ It has been demonstrated that the methyl and ring C\u2010atoms of methyl\u20101,3\u2010cyclohexadienes interchange their positions intramolecularly during the thermal conversion to toluene at temperatures above 600°C in a quartz flow system. Gas phase pyrolysis of double 13C\u2010labeled methyl\u20101,3\u2010cyclohexadienes with 13C\u2010labels for the primary and the tertiary C\u2010atom gave definite 13C\u2010distribution patterns in the aromatic ring systems of the formed toluene as well as benzene with far\u2010reaching similarities. The NMR data of the [13C2]toluene isotopomers definitely rule out that the observed integration of the methyl C\u2010atom into the ring system proceeds via the hitherto well\u2010established sequence: electrocyclic ring opening of the 5\u2010methyl\u20101,3\u2010cyclohexadiene to 1,3,5\u2010heptatriene, its sigmatropic 1,7\u2010H shift and ensuing recyclization of the 1,3,5\u2010heptatriene to methyl\u20101,3\u2010cyclohexadienes.

VPredicting the likelihood of emergency admission to hospital of older people: development and validation of the Emergency Admission Risk Likelihood Index (EARLI) __ Objective. To develop and evaluate an evidence-based tool for predicting the likelihood of emergency admission to hospital of older people aged 75 years and over in the UK. Methods. Prospective cohort study of older people registered with 17 general practices within Halton Primary Care Trust in the north-west of England. A questionnaire with 20 items was sent to older people aged 75 years. Items for inclusion in the questionnaire were selected from information gleaned from published literature and a pilot study. The primary outcome measurement was an emergency admission to hospital within 12 months of completing the questionnaire. A logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify those items which predicted emergency admission to hospital. A scoring system was devised to identify those at low, moderate, high and very high risk of admission, using the items identified in the predictive modelling process. Results. In total, 83% (3032) returned the questionnaire. A simple, six-item tool was developed and validatedthe Emergency Admission Risk Likelihood Index (EARLI). The items included in the tool are as follows: do you have heart problems? [odds ratio (OR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.151.72]; do you have leg ulcers? (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.042.04); can you go out of the house without help? (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.470.75); do you have problems with your memory and get confused? (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.191.81); have you been admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last 12 months? (OR 2.16, CI 1.722.72); and would you say the general state of your health is good? (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.530.82). The tool had high negative predictive value (>79%) and identified over 50% of those at high or very high risk of emergency admission. A very high score (>20) identified 6% of older people, 55% of whom had an emergency admission in the following 12 months. A low score (10) identified 74% of the older population of whom 17% were admitted. Conclusions. In this study, we have developed and validated a simple-to-apply tool for identifying older people in the UK who are at risk of having an emergency admission within the following 12 months. EARLI can be used as a simple triage-screening tool to help identify the most vulnerable older people, either to target interventions and support to reduce demand on hospital services or for inclusion in testing the effectiveness of different preventive interventions.

VAssessment of the risk approach to maternity care in a district hospital in rural Tanzania __ OBJECTIVE: The impact of the risk approach to maternity care in a district hospital in rural Tanzania has been investigated. METHOD: Data have been derived from a 1-month study. Of the women who lived within 5 km of a hospital (area I) 98% actually gave birth in hospital. The pattern of complications of this area is assumed to be representative for the pattern of the district as a whole. RESULT: Only 36/168 (21%) women with high risk pregnancies living further than 5 km from a hospital, came to hospital for delivery. Of the women with low risk pregnancies (in area I) 4/89 (5%) still had a complicated delivery. CONCLUSION: The risk approach, used to select women with high risk pregnancies should be used more extensively and as unexpected complications at the local center occur, basic facilities to deal with those problems should be made available at this level.

VA transient deficit of motion perception in human __ We studied the motion perception abilities in a young adult, SF, who had her right occipito-temporal cortices resected to treat epilepsy. Following resection, SF showed transient deficits of both first- and second-order motion perception that recovered to normal within weeks. Previous human studies have shown either first- or second n order motion deficits that have lasted months or years after cerebral damage. SF also showed a transient defect in processing of shape-from-motion with normal perception of shape from non-motion cues. Furthermore, she showed greatly increased reaction times for a mental rotation task, but not for a lexical decision task. The nature and quick recovery of the deficits in SF resembles the transient motion perception deficit observed in monkey following ibotenic acid lesions, and provides additional evidence that humans possess specialized cortical areas subserving similar motion perception functions.

VHabitat evaluation procedures (HEP) applied to mitigation banking in North Carolina __ Fifteen highway sites in eastern North Carolina were evaluated for anticipated bottomland hardwood wetland losses resulting from roadway construction. Wetland takings were expressed in acres of HEP (habitat evaluation procedures) units for comparative purposes. Debits were withdrawn from the North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT's) Company Swamp mitigation bank. Acre-for-acre transactions were found to provide only one third of the functional value replacement when compared to HEP unit debiting. In addition, an analysis of accrued habitat unit values for the 15 sites over the 90-year study period revealed negligible differences. Study findings demonstrated that similar systems evaluated under similar circumstances over similar periods of time may result in similar accrued HEP values.

VNo evidence for a substantial involvement of primary motor hand area in handedness judgements: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study __ Twelve right\u2010handed volunteers were asked to judge the laterality of a hand stimulus by pressing a button with one of their toes. Judgements were based on two\u2010dimensional drawings of the back or palm of a right or left hand at various orientations. Suprathreshold single\u2010pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was given to the left primary motor hand area (M1\u2010HAND) at 0, 200, 400, 600, 800 or 1000\u2003ms after stimulus onset to probe the functional involvement of the dominant left M1 at various stages of handedness recognition. We found that mean reaction times and error rates increased with angle of rotation depending on the actual biomechanical constraints of the hand but suprathreshold TMS had no influence on task performance regardless of the timing of TMS. However, the excitability of the corticomotor output from the left M1\u2010HAND was modulated during the reaction. Judging left hand drawings was associated with an attenuation of motor\u2010evoked potentials 300\u2013100\u2003ms before the response, whereas judging right hand drawings facilitated the motor\u2010evoked potentials only immediately before the response. These effects were the same for pictures of backs and palms and were independent of the angle of rotation. The failure of TMS to affect task performance suggests that there is no time window during which the M1\u2010HAND makes a critical contribution to mental rotation of the hand. The modulation of motor\u2010evoked potentials according to the laterality of the stimulus indicates a secondary effect of the task on corticomotor excitability that is not directly related to mental rotation itself.

VCarboxyl-terminal tripeptide of \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone antagonizes interleukin-1-induced anorexia __ Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1), a cytokine released from inflammatory cells, is thought to be involved in the anorexia associated with severe infection. To assess a possible role of the amino acid sequence found in the supposed IL-1 receptor binding sites, we determined the antagonistic effects of \u03b1-melanocytc-stimulating hormone (MSH) and the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide of \u03b1-MSH-(11\u201313) (\u03b1-MSH-(11\u201313)) on the anorexia induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 0.5 pmol IL-1. The parent \u03b1-MSH molecule completely prevented the induction of anorexia by IL-1 at both doses tested, 0.5 and 5.0 pmol. In contrast, \u03b1-MSH-(11\u201313) prevented the IL-1-induccd anorexia only at 5.0 pmol, but not at 0.5 pmol. Intracerebroventricular injection of 5 pmol of the parent \u03b1-MSH molecule alone temporarily decreased food consumption at 1\u20132 h; 5.0 pmol of \u03b1-MSH-(11\u201313) alone did not affect food consumption. These data indicate that \u03b1-MSH can antagonize the anorexic effects of IL-1. The carboxyl-terminal tripeptide portion of \u03b1-MSH may be important for the antagonistic action of \u03b1-MSH on the anorexia induced by IL-1.

VThe mental and the neural: Psychological and neural studies of mental rotation and memory scanning __ In this article we review studies pertaining to psychophysical measurements and neural correlates of tasks requiring the processing of directional information in spatial motor tasks. The results of psychological studies in human subjects indicate that time-consuming processes underlie mental rotation and memory scanning. Other studies have suggested that these processes may rely on different basic mechanisms. A direct insight into their neural mechanisms was obtained analyzing the activity of single cells and neuronal populations in the brain of behaving monkeys performing the same tasks. These studies revealed the nature of the neural processes underlying mental rotation and memory scanning and confirmed their different nature.

VContralateral Coding of Imagined Body Parts in the Superior Parietal Lobe __ In monkeys, neurons in the superior parietal lobe (area 5) code for spatial position of contralateral body parts by combining visual and somatosensory signals. Using a modified version of the classical mental rotation task, we were able to demonstrate that in humans activation in the contralateral superior parietal lobe could be evoked when mental rotation was combined with motor imagery of hands. These findings show that even in the absence of visual and somatosensory input, information provided by motor imagery suffices to induce contralateral superior parietal lobe monitoring of the imagined limb configuration. This constitutes an important prerequisite for effective imagined motor practice that can be used to improve actual motor performance.

VFailure to support the right\u2010shift theory s hypothesis of a \u2018heterozygote advantage\u2019 for cognitive abilities __ Annett's (1985) \u2018right\u2010shift\u2019 theory of language dominance and handedness posits three genotypes, rs ++, rs +\u2212 and rs \u2212\u2212, and Annett has hypothesized that there are cognitive ability correlates of these genotypes. The rs ++ genotype person is held to be at risk for maldevelopment of spatial or other right hemisphere\u2010based cognitive abilities, and the rs \u2212\u2212 genotype individual is held to be at risk for maldevelopment of phonological abilities. Noting that there must be some adaptive advantage conferred by the heterozygous genotype for it to have survived over a presumably long period of evolution, Annett has hypothesized that heterozygotes are afforded an adaptive advantage over homozygotes because of their freedom from \u2018risks\u2019 to intelligence generally. Annett and colleagues have used two different indices, or markers, from which they have inferred differing concentrations of the three genotypes within groups of participants. One marker, based on responses to hand preference items of the Annett Handedness Inventory, was found by Annett (1992) to support her theory in that the least dextral of right\u2010handed participants did best on spatial tests. The other marker Annett has used is based on the degree of right\u2010hand advantage on a simple peg moving speed task. The present study utilized both methods and studied the performances of 259 dextral college men and women on two tests of mental rotation ability and two tests of verbal abilities. Results were not supportive of the heterozygote advantage hypothesis, and suggested that visuospatial ability was modestly related to greater dextrality of participants.

VPhysiological variation in rectal compliance __ The volume (V) of air inflated in a latex balloon placed in the rectum and the corresponding pressures (P) were measured in 48 subjects (24 men and 24 women) at three points: (1) earliest defaecation urge; (2) constant defaecation urge; and (3) maximum tolerable volume (MTV). The rectal pressures in all three cases were higher in men than in women. Woman aged over 60 years had higher rectal compliance (\u0394V/\u0394P) than men in the same age group, while no difference was found between men and women below the age of 60 years. Day\u2010to\u2010day variation of the measurements was tested in ten subjects. Reproducibility was good only for MTV (95 per cent confidence interval 57\u2014183 per cent). Reproducibility of rectal compliance decreased with increasing values for this parameter. No such trend was found for the other parameters. In conclusion, MTV is a reproducible parameter and suitable for clinical use in evaluation of patients with faecal incontinence or constipation.

VContinuous tracking of coronal outflows: Two kinds of coronal mass ejections __ We have developed a new technique for tracking white\u2010light coronal intensity features and have used this technique to construct continuous height/time maps of coronal ejecta as they move outward through the 2\u201330 Rs field of view of the Large\u2010Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. Displayed as gray\u2010scale images, these height/time maps provide continuous histories of the motions along selected radial paths in the corona and reveal a variety of accelerating and decelerating features, including two principal types of coronal mass ejections (CMEs): (1) Gradual CMEs, apparently formed when prominences and their cavities rise up from below coronal streamers: When seen broadside, these events acquire balloon\u2010like shapes containing central cores, and their leading edges accelerate gradually to speeds in the range 400\u2013600 km/s before leaving the 2\u201330 Rs field of view. The cores fall behind with speeds in the range 300\u2013400 km/s. Seen along the line of sight, these events appear as smooth halos around the occulting disk, consistent with head\u2010on views of optically thin bubbles stretched out from the Sun. At the relatively larger radial distances seen from this \u201chead\u2010on\u201d perspective, gradually accelerating CMEs fade out sooner and seem to reach a constant speed more quickly than when seen broadside. Some suitably directed gradual CMEs are associated with interplanetary shocks and geomagnetic storms. (2) Impulsive CMEs, often associated with flares and Moreton waves on the visible disk: When seen broadside, these CMEs move uniformly across the 2\u201330 Rs field of view with speeds typically in excess of 750 km/s. At the relatively larger radial distances seen from a head\u2010on perspective, impulsive events tend to have a more ragged structure than the gradual CMEs and show clear evidence of deceleration, sometimes reducing their speeds from 1000 to 500 km/s in 1 hour. Such decelerations are too large to represent ballistic motions in the Sun's gravitational field but might be caused by shock waves, sweeping up material far from the Sun.

VLocalization and quantitative evaluation of potent local binding sites on the accessible Lennard\u2013jones surface __ This article presents a new method for topological analysis of molecular surfaces. Explicit representation of the van der Waals interaction according to the Lennard\u2010Jones potential enabled determination of the function of the maximum radius of a hypothetical atomic probe in any location, r, inside the host's domain. The size of the spatial gradient of the maximal probe's volume (named the \u03be value) at that location was found to be a good descriptor of the local shape of the host. Consequently, mapping of the host domain according to the \u03be value could be used as a quantitative tool for localization of potent local binding sites. The proposed method is illustrated by mapping an organic host (calix[4]arene) as well as an enzyme (HIV\u2010aspartic protease). Analysis of the calix[4]arene derivative revealed that the proposed method reproduces immediately the known binding site of conic calix[4]arenes. The second test case demonstrated how the catalytic site of the enzyme could be disassembled into many local binding sites. Some of these sites, located according to the proposed method, were found to follow the shape of a known inhibitor of the enzyme in a complementary manner. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

VThe Concepts of Successful and Positive Ageing __ Social scientists frequently refer to the \u2018greying\u2019 of the population in the west, the extension of the average lifespan to around the age of 76, and the projected increases in the numbers of people aged 85 and over, with the ensuing problems of chronic illness and disability that often accompany very old age. 1Increasing interest is being expressed in positive aspects of ageing: given the increases in life expectancy during this century, is it resulting in a life worth living? Concern is heightened by the estimate that, although most people aged 65+ live in their own homes and are relatively healthy and independent, years of disability can begin as early as 60 years. Conversely, some researchers and policy makers feel that enough time has been spent on the negative aspects of ageing and that the balance should be addressed by analysing successful, or positive ageing (sometimes defined in terms of an overlapping but separate dimension \u2018health-related quality of life\u2019), with the aim of promoting well-being for future generations.

VFull Wave Single and Double Scatter from Rough Surfaces __ Using the full wave approach, the single and double scattered electromagnetic fields from deterministic one-dimensional rough surfaces are computed. Full wave expressions for the single and double scattered far fields are given in terms of multidimensional integrals. These integrals are evaluated using the Cornell National Supercomputer IBM/3090. Applying the steepest descent approximation to the double scattered field expressions, the dimensions of the integrals are reduced from four to two in the case of one-dimensional rough surfaces. It is shown that double scatter in the backward direction is significant for near normal incidence when the rough surface is highly conducting and its mean square slope is very large. Even for one-dimensional rough surfaces, depolarization occurs when the reference plane of incidence is not parallel to the local planes of incidence and scatter. A geometrical optics approximation is used to interpret the results of the double scattered fields for normal incidence near backscatter. The physical interpretation of the results could shed light on the observed fluctuations in the enhanced backscatter phenomenon as the angle of incidence increases from near normal to grazing angles. The results show that double scatter strongly depends upon the mean square slope, the conductivity of the rough surface and the angle of incidence.

VDynamic viscoelasticity during sol\u2014gel reactions __ The evolution of viscoelasticity during the gelation reactions of tetraethoxysilane solutions has been monitored from initial reactant mixing through the sol\u2014gel transition with the multiple lumped resonator instrument. Gel points are determined by the observation of a frequency-independent loss tangent at a singular extent of reaction. The frequency dependence of G\u2032 and G\u2033 can be compared with recent theoretical models and simulations. Comparisons are made between the results for the chemical gel and the physical gel of gelatin. Again the occurrence of a frequency independent loss tangent corresponds to the macroscopic gel point.

VInfluence of graviceptives cues at different level of visual information processing: The effect of prolonged weightlessness __ We evaluated the influence of prolonged weightlessness on the performance of visual tasks in the course of the Russian-French missions ANTARES, Post-ANTARES and ALTAIR aboard the MIR station. Eight cosmonauts were subjects in two experiments executed pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight sessions. In the first experiment, cosmonauts performed a task of symmetry detection in 2-D polygons. The results indicate that this detection is locked in a head retinal reference frame rather than in an environmentally defined one as meridional orientations of symmetry axis (vertical and horizontal) elicited faster response times than oblique ones. However, in weightlessness the saliency of a retinally vertical axis of symmetry is no longer significantly different from an horizontal axis. In the second experiment, cosmonauts performed a mental rotation task in which they judged whether two 3-D objects presented in different orientations were identical. Performance on this task is basically identical in weightlessness and normal gravity.

VVisible Sympathetic Activity as a Social Signal in Anolis carolinensis: Changes in Aggression and Plasma Catecholamines __ Darkening of postorbital skin in Anolis carolinensis occurs during stressful situations and is stimulated by sympathetic activation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors via adrenal catecholamines. This eyespot forms more rapidly in dominant males during social interaction. Eyespot darkening (green to black) appears to function as a social signal communicating sympathetic activation and limiting aggressive interaction. To assess the value of the eyespot as a social signal, males were painted postorbitally with green, black, or red paint. Each male was exposed to a mirror following acclimation to the cage. The total number of aggressive displays toward the mirror image was greatest when eyespots were masked by green paint. In contrast, black or red artificial eyespots, regardless of size, inhibited biting behavior toward the mirror image. The most aggressive males, those who saw a reflected opponent with no eyespot (hidden with green paint), had significantly higher levels of all plasma catecholamines. These results suggest that A. carolinensis use information from the eyespot to assess their opponent's readiness to fight and thereby determine whether to be aggressive. Darkened eyespots are capable of inhibiting aggression, whereas aggressive displays from an opponent in the mirror without darkened eyespots do not. Darkened eyespots reflect rapid changes in plasma NE, DA, and Epi that may signal dominant social status.

VRandom-matrix model for quantum Brownian motion __ We use a random band-matrix model for the system\u2013bath interaction to derive a Markovian master equation for the time evolution of one-dimensional quantum systems weakly coupled to a heat bath. We study in detail the damped harmonic oscillator and discuss the fluctuation-dissipation relation. In the large-bandwidth, high-temperature limit, our master equation coincides with the equations derived by Agarwal and Caldeira\u2013Leggett. This shows that the Markovian master equations for quantum Brownian motion are independent of model assumptions used in their derivation and, thus, universal.

VThe functional significance of ERP effects during mental rotation __ In a parity judgment task, the ERPs at parietal electrode sites become more negative as more mental rotation has to be executed. This article provides a review of the empirical evidence regarding this amplitude modulation. More specifically, experiments are reported that validate both the functional relationship between mental rotation and the amplitude modulation as well as the temporal relationship both in single\u2010 and in dual\u2010task situations. Additionally, ERP effects are reported in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm with mental rotation as the second task. Finally, unresolved issues are discussed that, I hope, might stimulate future research.

VSex Differences in Mental Rotation and How They Add to the Understanding of Autism __ The most consistent cognitive sex differences have been found in the visuo-spatial domain, using Mental Rotation (MR) tasks. Such sex differences have been suggested to bear implications on our understanding of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, it is still debated how the sex difference in MR performance relates to differences between individuals with ASD compared to typically developed control persons (TD). To provide a detailed exploration of sex differences in MR performance, we studied rotational (indicated by slopes) and non-rotational aspects (indicated by intercepts) of the MR task in TD individuals (total N = 50). Second-to-fourth digit length ratios (2D:4D) were measured to investigate the associations between prenatal testosterone and performance on MR tasks. Handedness was assessed by the use of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory in order to examine the relation between handedness and MR performance. In addition, we investigated the relation of spatial to systemising abilities, both of which have been associated with sex differences and with ASD, employing the Intuitive Physics Test (IPT). Results showed a male advantage in rotational aspects of the MR task, which correlated with IPT results. These findings are in contrast to the MR performance of individuals with ASD who have been shown to outperform TD persons in the non-rotational aspects of the MR task. These results suggest that the differences in MR performance due to ASD are different from sex-related differences in TD persons, in other words, ASD is not a simple and continuous extension of the male cognitive profile into the psychopathological range as the extreme male brain hypothesis (EMB) of ASD would suggest.

VMental spatial transformations of objects and perspective __ This study sought evidence for the independence of two classes of mental spatial transformation: object-based spatial transformations and egocentric perspective transformations. Two tasks were designed to selectively elicit these two transformations using the same materials, participants, and task parameters: one required same-different judgments about pairs of pictures, while the other required left-right judgments about single pictures. For pictures of human bodies, the two tasks showed strikingly different patterns of response time as a function of stimulus orientation. Moreover, across individuals, the two tasks had different relationships to psychometric tests of spatial ability. The chronometric and individual difference data converge with neuropsychological and neuroimaging data in suggesting that different mental spatial transformations are performed by dissociable neural systems.

VNeuroimaging Studies of Mental Rotation: A Meta-analysis and Review __ Mental rotation is a hypothesized imagery process that has inspired controversy regarding the substrate of human spatial reasoning. Two central questions about mental rotation remain: Does mental rotation depend on analog spatial representations, and does mental rotation depend on motor simulation? A review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies help answer these questions. Mental rotation is accompanied by increased activity in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent regions. These areas contain spatially mapped representations, and activity in these areas is modulated by parametric manipulations of mental rotation tasks, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations. Mental rotation also is accompanied by activity in the medial superior precentral cortex, particularly under conditions that favor motor simulation, supporting the view that mental rotation depends on motor simulation in some situations. The relationship between mental rotation and motor simulation can be understood in terms of how these two processes update spatial reference frames.

VThe influence of long-term practice on mental rotation of 3-D objects __ We evaluated the influence of long-term practice on the performance of a mental rotation task in which subjects judged whether two 3-D objects presented in different orientations were identical. Stimuli and experimental conditions were analogous to those used by Shepard and Metzler. Sixteen subjects were selected, to test the influence of aptitude for mental imagery on this learning process. Subjects participated in 12 to 15 sessions over 6 weeks. Two catalogues of different stimuli were alternatively used during three (or six) consecutive sessions to determine the influence of complexity and familiarity of figures. For all subjects, the inverse of the velocity of mental rotation along the sessions was adequately fitted by a decreasing exponential curve. However, evidence for mental rotation did not disappear, even after 15 sessions. Asymptotic variations can be attributed to differences in stimuli as well as imaging skills of subjects. Our results lead to a new interpretation of the mental rotation process.

VThe influence of mirror reversals on male and female performance in spatial tasks: A componential look __ O'Boyle and Hoff (Neuropsychologia, 25, 977\u2013982, 1987) reported that females were faster and more accurate than males at mirror-tracing the outline of random shapes. To account for this differential performance, the authors advanced two alternative explanations. The first was a \u2018Spatial Stroop\u2019 effect which suggested that, because of their enhanced spatial ability, males are especially disadvantaged in escaping the misleading visual feedback provided by the mirror, resulting in slower and less accurate tracings. The second was a \u2018manipulospatial\u2019 hypothesis which suggested that the tracing advantage was related to female superiority in fine-detailed motor control, and perhaps, differential practice at performing skilled motor tasks in mirror-reversed contexts. In the present study, two experiments were conducted to assess the relative viability of these explanations. In Experiment 1, the WAIS-R Block Design task was performed within and outside the context of a mirror. This was done to determine if the observed female advantage was restricted to mirror-tracing per se, or generalizable to other manipulospatial tasks. In Experiment 2, a mental rotation task was performed within and outside the context of a mirror. The latter was designed to reveal if the removal of the motor component would affect the obtained sex difference. The present findings suggest that as long as some form of precision motor manipulation is required, females are superior to males at mirror-reversed spatial tasks. However, when the motor component is eliminated, a male performance advantage emerges in both normal and mirror-reversed contexts, suggesting that the manipulospatial hypothesis is the more viable explanation.

VRole of AQP2 during apoptosis in cortical collecting duct cells __ Background information. A major hallmark of apoptosis is cell shrinkage, termed apoptotic volume decrease, due to the cellular outflow of potassium and chloride ions, followed by osmotically obliged water. In many cells, the ionic pathways triggered during the apoptotic volume decrease may be similar to that observed during a regulatory volume decrease response under hypotonic conditions. However, the pathways involved in water loss during apoptosis have been largely ignored. It was recently reported that in some systems this water movement is mediated via specific water channels (aquaporins). Nevertheless, it is important to identify whether this is a ubiquitous aspect of apoptosis as well as to define the mechanisms involved. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of aquaporin\u20102 during apoptosis in renal\u2010collecting duct cells. We evaluated the putative relationship between aquaporin\u20102 expression and the activation of the ionic pathways involved in the regulatory volume response. Results. Apoptosis was induced by incubating cells with a hypertonic solution or with cycloheximide in two cortical collecting duct cell lines: one not expressing aquaporins and the other stably transfected with aquaporin\u20102. Typical features of apoptosis were evaluated with different approaches and the water permeability was measured by fluorescence videomicroscopy. Our results show that the rate of apoptosis is significantly increased in aquaporin\u20102 cells and it is linked to the rapid activation of volume\u2010regulatory potassium and chloride channels. Furthermore, the water permeability of cells expressing aquaporin\u20102 was strongly reduced during the apoptotic process and it occurs before DNA degradation. Conclusions. These results let us propose that under apoptotic stimulation aquaporin\u20102 would act as a sensor leading to a co\u2010ordinated activation of specific ionic channels for potassium and chloride efflux, resulting in both more rapid cell shrinkage and more rapid achievement of adequate levels of ions necessary to activate the enzymatic apoptotic cascade.

VHomoeopathic Arnica and Rhus toxicodendron for delayed onset muscle soreness __ We intend to develop a simple, reproducible, clinical model to test the null hypothesis thatthe effects of ultramolecular homoeopathic preparations are always equivalent to placebo. A pilot of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the effects of Arnica and Rhus tox 30c on delayed onset muscle soreness. 50 healthy volunteers undertook a standard bench-stepping exercise, with outcome assessed using a validated soreness scale. Though the results of the trial favoured homoeopathy, differences between groups were small and did not reach statistical signficance (p>0.2). A sub-group analysis of subjects who did not take vigorous exercise and who would therefore be expected to be more responsive to treatment showed clinically but not statistically significant differences between groups (p>0.2). A second trial is currently under way in an attempt to replicate these findings.

VComputational Verifiable Secret Sharing Revisited __ Abstract: Verifiable secret sharing (VSS) is an important primitive in distributed cryptography that allows a dealer to share a secret among n parties in the presence of an adversary controlling at most t of them. In the computational setting, the feasibility of VSS schemes based on commitments was established over two decades ago. Interestingly, all known computational VSS schemes rely on the homomorphic nature of these commitments or achieve weaker guarantees. As homomorphism is not inherent to commitments or to the computational setting in general, a closer look at its utility to VSS is called for. In this work, we demonstrate that homomorphism of commitments is not a necessity for computational VSS in the synchronous or in the asynchronous communication model. We present new VSS schemes based only on the definitional properties of commitments that are almost as good as the existing VSS schemes based on homomorphic commitments. Importantly, they have significantly lower communication complexities than their (statistical or perfect) unconditional counterparts. Further, in the synchronous communication model, we observe that a crucial interactive complexity measure of round complexity has never been formally studied for computational VSS. Interestingly, for the optimal resiliency conditions, the least possible round complexity in the known computational VSS schemes is identical to that in the (statistical or perfect) unconditional setting: three rounds. Considering the strength of the computational setting, this equivalence is certainly surprising. In this work, we show that three rounds are actually not mandatory for computational VSS. We present the first two-round VSS scheme for n\u2009\u2265\u20092t\u2009+\u20091 and lower-bound the result tightly by proving the impossibility of one-round computational VSS for t\u2009\u2265\u20092 or n\u2009\u2264\u20093t. We also include a new two-round VSS scheme using homomorphic commitments that has the same communication complexity as the well-known three-round Feldman and Pedersen VSS schemes.

VMental rotation within linguistic and non-linguistic domains in users of American sign language __ American sign language (ASL) uses space itself to encode spatial information. Spatial scenes are most often described from the perspective of the person signing (the `narrator'), such that the viewer must perform what amounts to a 180° mental rotation to correctly comprehend the description. But scenes can also be described, non-canonically, from the viewer's perspective, in which case no rotation is required. Is mental rotation during sign language processing difficult for ASL signers? Are there differences between linguistic and non-linguistic mental rotation? Experiment 1 required subjects to decide whether a signed description matched a room presented on videotape. Deaf ASL signers were more accurate when viewing scenes described from the narrator's perspective (even though rotation is required) than from the viewer's perspective (no rotation required). In Experiment 2, deaf signers and hearing non-signers viewed videotapes of objects appearing briefly and sequentially on a board marked with an entrance. This board either matched an identical board in front of the subject or was rotated 180°. Subjects were asked to place objects on their board in the orientation and location shown on the video, making the appropriate rotation when required. All subjects were significantly less accurate when rotation was required, but ASL signers performed significantly better than hearing non-signers under rotation. ASL signers were also more accurate in remembering object orientation. Signers then viewed a video in which the same scenes were signed from the two perspectives (i.e. rotation required or no rotation required). In contrast to their performance with real objects, signers did not show the typical mental rotation effect. Males outperformed females on the rotation task with objects, but the superiority disappeared in the linguistic condition. We discuss the nature of the ASL mental rotation transformation, and we conclude that habitual use of ASL can enhance non-linguistic cognitive processes thus providing evidence for (a form of) the linguistic relativity hypothesis.

VUse of landmarks in cognitive mapping: Gender differences in self report versus performance __ Gender differences were examined among 160 college students in the self report of spatial abilities as well as performance on two spatial tasks, the mental rotations test and a cognitive mapping task. Subjects were asked to view a brief videotape of the interior of a three bedroom, one level home and to draw a sketch map of the floor plan of the home. Presence or absence of landmarks was manipulated by having half the participants view a three minute video tour of a furnished home, while the other half viewed a video tour of the same home unfurnished. Results revealed a gender difference, favoring men, for the mental rotation test, but no gender difference in the cognitive mapping task. Overall, subjects in the landmarks present condition (furnished home) drew more accurate floor plans than did those in the minimal landmarks condition (unfurnished home). Though men and women performed equally well on the cognitive mapping task, women reported less confidence in the accuracy of their floor plans.

VGender-related differences in spatial ability and the k factor of general spatial ability in a population of academically talented students __ Spatial ability is an area of cognitive functioning in which evidence of gender-related differences in performance tends to emerge relatively often. Previous research has found, however, that different types of spatial tasks differ in their amounts of gender-sensitivity. Mental rotation tasks, for instance, have often shown large gender-related differences in favour of males, whereas there are small differences or advantages for females on visual memory tasks. Therefore, the present study examined the profile of differences across a wide array of types of spatial tasks. Two forms of a spatial test battery containing 14 types of items each were administered to academically talented middle and high school students. Factor analysis yielded a strong general factor (termed \u201ck factor\u201d) underlying performance in both forms. The gender-sensitivity of the item types depended to a considerable extent on the loadings of the subtests on the k factor. When the k factor was partialled out of the variances of the tests, gender-related differences on the various types of items were reduced, often to insignificance, and some tests that had initially exhibited little gender-related variance showed advantages for females. Mental rotation and visualization of perspectives, however, consistently showed substantial gender-related variance beyond the variation explained by the k factor.

VThe role of the frontal cortex in the use of advance information in a mental rotation paradigm __ The present study explored the ability of patients with unilateral frontal or temporal lobe excisions to use advance information in a choice-reaction-time task that required the discrimination of alphanumeric characters on the basis of their form of presentation, normal or mirror-image. The response time of the subjects in all groups depended upon the target's angular orientation, when no information regarding the orientation and the identity of the impending target was provided (No Information condition). In the Advance Information condition, reaction time did not vary greatly with changes in the target's orientation except for the subjects with left or right frontal lobe excisions. These findings provide evidence of the importance of the frontal cortex in the use of advance information.

VDevelopmental Differences in Giving Directions: Spatial Frames of Reference and Mental Rotation __ The spatial referents \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d are one of the most common means for specifying direction and location, yet little is known about the processes that underlie the use of these concepts. Two studies tested the hypothesis that children and adults who correctly identify left\u2010right directions from nonoccupied orientations perform imagined rotations to align the self's frame of reference with the other's. Children who make incorrect judgments from nonoccupied orientations were hypothesized to use a stationary egocentric reference frame. 28 6\u2010 and 8\u2010year\u2010old children and 9 adults were tested on a task that required making left\u2010right direction judgments from various rotated orientations. The results supported the mental rotation hypothesis: Only correct responders showed a linear increase in response time with increasing angular disparity between the self and other. Mental rotation permits the continued use of an egocentric reference frame for specifying left\u2010right relations from nonoccupied positions.

VA New Twist on Studying the Development of Dynamic Spatial Transformations: Mental Paper Folding in Young Children __ The relation of spatial skills to academic success in areas such as math and science has sparked discussion in early education around how spatial thinking skills might be included in early schooling. Planning and evaluating new curricula or interventions requires understanding these skills and having the means to assess them. Prior developmental research focused primarily on one aspect of dynamic spatial transformations (DST), namely mental rotation. This study broadens our knowledge by addressing another important DST, namely mental folding. We devised a new test suitable for young children. Performance of 180 children between 4 and 7\u2009years suggests that mental folding appears at around 5.5\u2009years of age, although there were also marked individual differences. These data on the emergence of DST suggest that educational programs targeting this skill could start in preschool or kindergarten and provide a means to assess the effectiveness of such efforts.

VGirls who use \u201cmasculine\u201d problem-solving strategies on a spatial task: Proposed genetic and environmental factors __ This study investigated strategy and performance differences between right-handed boys and girls on a mental rotation task. Based on predictions from Casey and Brabeck's (1990) theory of sex differences, the study was also designed to identify a target group of right-handed girls with the optimal combination of genetic and environmental factors (high math/science achievers with nonright-handed immediate relatives). They were predicted to show strategies and performance more similar to those of the boys than to those of both the low math/science achieving girls and the high math/science girls with all right-handed immediate relatives (predicted to have the nonoptimal genotype). Strategy preference was measured using selective interference, whereby subjects solved mental rotation items concurrently with either verbal or visual-spatial interference tasks. Group comparisons were made on the amount of decrement in mental rotation performance as a result of the two types of interference tasks. This provided a basis for comparing the groups on the use of visual-spatial or verbal strategies on the mental rotation task. The boys: (1) did not show a significant advantage over the girls on the mental rotation items, but (2) did depend more on visual-spatial strategies than the girls, and (3) depended less on verbal strategies than the girls. The target girls: (1) outperformed the low math/science achieving girls on the mental rotation items and did not show a significant advantage over the other high math/science group, (2) depended more on visual-spatial strategies than both the other two groups of girls, and (3) depended less on verbal strategies than the low math/science girls, while showing no significant difference compared to the nonoptimal high math/science girls. Examining within-group differences, the boys preferred visual-spatial strategies, while the girls in both the nontarget groups preferred verbal ones. However, for the target girls, no within-subject strategy differences were found. The present findings support the theory that, like the boys, the target girls depend more on visual-spatial strategies than do other girls. It is possible that the target girls use a combination of visual-spatial and verbal strategies when solving mental rotation tasks.

VImmunoperoxidase staining for identification of Aspergillus species in routinely processed tissue sections. __ AIMS: To evaluate the performance of an immunoperoxidase stain using the monoclonal antibody EB-A1 to detect Aspergillus species in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue. METHODS: The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 directed against galactomannan was used to detect Aspergillus species in 23 patients with suspected or confirmed invasive aspergillosis. Immunostaining was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue using the streptavidin-biotin method and compared with conventional haematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Gomori-Grocott stains. Results of immunostaining were semiquantitatively analysed with regard to both intensity of staining and number of positively staining micro-organisms. Tissue sections from 16 patients with confirmed invasive mycoses due to Candida species, Apophysomyces elegans, Rhizopus oryzae, Pseudallescheria boydii and Histoplasma capsulatum were used as controls. RESULTS: In 19 (83%) of 23 cases invasive aspergillosis was confirmed by both histological examination and culture (18 Aspergillus fumigatus and one A flavus). Immunoperoxidase stains were positive in 17 (89%) of 19 cases including one case of disseminated infection due to A flavus. Furthermore, the immunoperoxidase stain was positive in a culture negative tissue section with histological evidence of mycelial development, indicating the presence of Aspergillus species. Some cross-reactivity was observed with the highly related fungus P boydii, although the number of mycelial elements that stained was low. CONCLUSIONS: Immunoperoxidase staining using the monoclonal antibody EB-A1 performs well on routinely processed tissue sections and permits detection and generic identification of Aspergillus species, although it was no better than conventional histopathology in identifying the presence of an infection. An additional advantage is that the immunostain may help to provide an aetiological diagnosis when cultures remain negative.

VThermal decomposition of indene. Experimental results and kinetic modeling __ The thermal decomposition of indene was studied behind reflected shock waves in a pressurized driver single-pulse shock tube over the temperature range 1150\u20131900 K and densities of \u22483×10\u22125 mol/cm3. GC analyses of post-shock mixtures revealed the presence of the following decomposition products, given in order of increasing molecular weight: CH4, C2H2, CH2=C=CH2, CH3C\u2261CH, C4H2, C6H6, C6H5\u2212CH3, C6H5\u2212C\u2261CH, and also naphthalene and its structural isomer, probably 1-methylene-1H-indene. Small or trace quantities of C2H4, C4H4, C5H6, C5H5\u2212C\u2261CH, and C6H4 were also found in the postshock mixtures. A kinetic scheme based on cyclopentadiene decomposition pathway alone cannot account for the observed product distribution. It can be accounted for if H-atom attachment to the \u03c0 bond in the five-membered ring followed by consecutive decomposition of the formed indanyl radical is assumed in addition to the indenyl channel. A reaction scheme with the two pathways containing 50 species and 74 elementary reactions reproduces very well the experimental product distribution. In this paper, we show the reaction scheme, the results of computer simulation, and sensitivity analysis. Differences and similarities in the reaction patterns of cyclopentadiene and indence are discussed.

VMotor processes in mental rotation __ Much indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that transformations of mental images are at least in part guided by motor processes, even in the case of images of abstract objects rather than of body parts. For example, rotation may be guided by processes that also prime one to see results of a specific motor action. We directly test the hypothesis by means of a dual-task paradigm in which subjects perform the Cooper\u2013Shepard mental rotation task while executing an unseen motor rotation in a given direction and at a previously-learned speed. Four results support the inference that mental rotation relies on motor processes. First, motor rotation that is compatible with mental rotation results in faster times and fewer errors in the imagery task than when the two rotations are incompatible. Second, the angle through which subjects rotate their mental images, and the angle through which they rotate a joystick handle are correlated, but only if the directions of the two rotations are compatible. Third, motor rotation modifies the classical inverted V-shaped mental rotation response time function, favoring the direction of the motor rotation; indeed, in some cases motor rotation even shifts the location of the minimum of this curve in the direction of the motor rotation. Fourth, the preceding effect is sensitive not only to the direction of the motor rotation, but also to the motor speed. A change in the speed of motor rotation can correspondingly slow down or speed up the mental rotation.

VfMRI Activation in a Visual-Perception Task: Network of Areas Detected Using the General Linear Model and Independent Components Analysis __ The Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, revised (MVPT-R), provides a measure of visual perceptual processing. It involves different cognitive elements including visual discrimination, spatial relationships, and mental rotation. We adapted the MVPT-R to an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) environment to investigate the brain regions involved in the interrelation of these cognitive elements. Two complementary analysis methods were employed to characterize the fMRI data: (a) a general linear model SPM approach based upon a model of the time course and a hemodynamic response estimate and (b) independent component analysis (ICA), which does not constrain the specific shape of the time course per se, although we did require it to be at least transiently task-related. Additionally, we implemented ICA in a novel way to create a group average that was compared with the SPM group results. Both methods yielded similar, but not identical, results and detected a network of robustly activated visual, inferior parietal, and frontal eye-field areas as well as thalamus and cerebellum. SPM appeared to be the more sensitive method and has a well-developed theoretical approach to thresholding. The ICA method segregated functional elements into separate maps and identified additional regions with extended activation in response to presented events. The results demonstrate the utility of complementary analyses for fMRI data and suggest that the cerebellum may play a significant role in visual perceptual processing. Additionally, results illustrate functional connectivity between frontal eye fields and prefrontal and parietal regions.

VSynthesis and perfection evaluation of NaA zeolite membrane __ The synthesis of NaA zeolite membrane on a porous \u03b1-Al2O3 support from clear solution and the evaluation of the perfection of the as-synthesized membrane by gas permeation were investigated. When an unseeded support was used, the NaA zeolite began to transform into other types of zeolites before a continuous NaA zeolite membrane formed. When the support was coated with nucleation seeds, not only the formation of NaA zeolite on the support surface was accelerated, but also the transformation of NaA zeolite into other types of zeolites was inhibited. A continuous NaA zeolite membrane can be formed. Perfection evaluation indicated that the NaA zeolite membrane with the synthesis time of 3 h showed the best perfection after a one-stage synthesis. The perfection of NaA zeolite membrane can be improved by employing the multi-stage synthesis method. The NaA zeolite membrane with a synthesis time of 2 h after a two-stage synthesis showed the best gas permeation performance. The permselectivity of H2/n-C4H10 and O2/N2 were 19.1 and 1.8, respectively, higher than those of the corresponding Knudsen diffusion selectivity of 5.39 and 0.94, which showed the molecular sieving effect of NaA zeolite. However, the permeation of n-C4H10 also indicated that the NaA zeolite membrane had certain defects, the diameter of which were larger than the NaA zeolite channels.

VSubmucous turbinectomy decreases not only nasal stiffness but also sneezing and rhinorrhea in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis __ Background: Turbinate surgery, in which mucous epithelium is resected, has often been used for patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, since the mucous epithelium is the principal site for immunoglobulin (Ig)E\u2010mediated allergic reactions and chronic inflammation. Objective: To assess the effect of submucous turbinectomy on allergic rhinitis. Methods: Sixty patients with severe perennial allergic rhinitis underwent submucous turbinectomy and were followed\u2010up for 1 year. Nasal symptoms were evaluated with a standard symptom score. Rhinometry was used to evaluate nasal congestion, and nasal provocation tests in vivo were performed to evaluate allergic reactions. In 16 cases, biopsies from the nose were also available for immunohistochemical analysis. These examinations were performed before and after submucous turbinectomy. Results: The mean total nasal symptom score (7.2\u2003±\u20031.7, mean\u2003±\u2003sd before surgery) was significantly reduced after surgery (1.2\u2003±\u20031.4, P\u2003<\u20030.0001), and the effect of the surgery on nasal symptoms continued for at least 12 months (1.9\u2003±\u20031.8, P\u2003<\u20030.0001). Submucous turbinectomy reduced both nasal discharge and sneezing, as well as nasal stiffness. Histopathological examination following surgery revealed that the lamina propria was occupied by fibrous tissues, and that the number of vessels, nasal glands, eosinophils and infiltrating IgE+ cells decreased in the turbinate. There were no significant differences in the levels of either house dust mite\u2010specific or non\u2010specific IgE in the serum between before and after surgery. Conclusion: Submucous turbinectomy preserving the ciliary epithelium is a powerful strategy for improving nasal symptoms induced by allergic reaction via the reduction in the number of allergy\u2010related cells in the nose.

VRapid dendritic growth in undercooled Ag-Cu melts __ The results of measurements of the reciprocal recalescence rise time (\u0394t)\u22121 of undercooled melts of an Ag-Cu alloy with 65 at.% Cu are presented. It is shown that (\u0394t)\u22121 is a semiquantitative measure of the growth rate. In agreement with observations already made on alloys with other compositions in this binary system, the growth rate as a function of the undercooling rises sharply at an undercooling corresponding to the T0 temperature. This behaviour can be explained in the framework of the theories of rapid dendritic growth, when the kinetic displacements of the solidus and liquidus are taken into account. A simple empirical expression for this kinetic effect is proposed. For the Ag-65 at.% Cu alloy the predictions of the theory are expressed as a plot of growth rate against undercooling and also in the form of a kinetic phase diagram. The predictions are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results.

VImpact of patient age on the outcome of primary breast carcinoma __ Background and Objectives: The poorer outcome amongst younger breast cancer patients continues to be an issue of debate. In order to clarify the prognostic value of patient age, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 1098 breast cancer patients. Methods: Patients were divided into two groups based on the age 35 (Group I, women aged 35 or younger, and Group II, women aged over 35). Clinico\u2010pathological parameters, 10\u2010year loco\u2010regional recurrence\u2010free (10LRRFS), distant relapse\u2010free (10DRFS), and overall (10OS) survival estimates were determined. Results: Among the 1098 patients, approximately 16.7% (183) were allocated to Group I and the other 83.3% (915) to Group II. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of histopathologic features or mean follow\u2010up. Group I had a poorer 10LRRFS of 86.8% (P\u2009=\u20090.036), 10DRFS of 57.7% (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and 10OS of 68.3% (P\u2009=\u20090.0001), compared with 93.9, 76.2, and 81.4% for Group II, respectively. Group I also showed a poorer 10DRFS when matched for stage and lymph node status as well. With lymph node status and tumor size, a patient age of younger than 35 was determined to be an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: These results indicate that patient age (younger than 35) shows an independent prognostic value and that survival differences by age may reflect differences in the tumor biology. J.

VUnder the microscope: Assessing surgical aptitude of otolaryngology residency applicants __ Objectives/Hypothesis:: Application to otolaryngology residency is a highly competitive process. Programs identify the best candidates by evaluating academic performance in medical school, board scores, research experience, performance during an interview, and letters of recommendation. Unfortunately, none of these metrics completely assess an applicant's capacity to learn and perform surgical skills. We describe a direct assessment of an applicant's ability for rapid surgical skill acquisition, manual dexterity, and response to stress that can be performed during the interview process. Study Design:: A retrospective study at an academic otolaryngology residency program. Methods:: After orientation, applicants were seated at a microsurgical training station and allotted 20 minutes to suture an incision using 10\u20100 nylon suture on a latex practice card. Their performance was graded using a 1\u2010to\u20105 scoring system for the following categories: microscope use, respect for tissue, instrument handling, knot tying and suture control, skills acquisition, and attitude toward the exercise. Applicants were given some instruction and assessed on their ability to incorporate what they had learned into their technique. Results:: The average total applicant score was 23.2, standard deviation (SD) 3.6 (maximum 30); 13.4% of applicants scored <1 SD below the mean, 66.1% scored within 1 SD of the mean, and 20.5% scored >1 SD above the mean. Conclusions:: The value of applicant screening tests in predicting surgical competency is controversial. We describe a direct assessment tool that may prove useful in identifying outliers, both high and low, to aid in final applicant ranking.

VThe tensile behaviour and toughness of poly(vinylidene chloride)/poly(butyl methacrylate) composites prepared by the concentrated emulsion approach __ Procedures for the preparation of poly(vinylidene chloride)/poly(butyl methacrylate) (PVDC/PBMA) composites based on concentrated emulsions are described. In one of them, two partially polymerized paste-like concentrated emulsions in water of two different systems were blended and subjected to complete polymerization. One of the systems was butyl methacrylate monomer (BMA), while the other was either vinylidene chloride monomer (VDC) or a dilute solution of PBMA in VDC. In the other procedure, a partially polymerized concentrated emulsion of VDC in water was blended with BMA monomer, and the paste-like system obtained was further polymerized. The composites thus obtained contained PVDC, PBMA and also some copolymer. The glass transition temperatures and the melting points measured by differential scanning calorimetry allowed qualitative identification of the presence of the above compounds. VDC-co-BMA copolymers of various compositions were also prepared via the concentrated emulsion method for comparison purposes. The effects of the preparation procedure, of the molar ratio of the two monomers and of the concentration of surfactant in the continuous water phase on the tensile properties were investigated. The toughness of the composites is much better than that of the copolymers.

VShould I Brag? Nature and Impact of Positive and Boastful Disclosures for Women and Men __ What is the nature of a \u201cpositive\u201d disclosure versus a \u201cboastful\u201d one? How are those who use these different types of disclosures differentially construed? A set of three studies was designed to investigate three general issues. Study 1 asked respondents to rate characters who disclosed in a boastful, positive, or negative fashion. Boasters and positive disclosers were viewed as more competent than negative disclosers, negative and positive disclosers were viewed as more socially sensitive than boasters, and positive disclosers were best liked. In Study 2, the gender of the target disclosing positively or boastfully was manipulated. Compared to the boaster, the positive discloser was rated as more socially involved and feminine (less masculine) but less competent. Polarized judgments were made by both genders. Study 3 had individuals generate \u201cboasts\u201d and \u201cpositive statements.\u201d The few gender differences that emerged suggest that although females\u2019 bragging strategies may be less extreme or extensive, it is only when gender information is known that the brags of men and women are differentially construed. The present work suggests that men and women, as perceivers, may differentially activate cognitive structures (involving social involvement and femininity, on one hand, and competence and masculinity, on the other) when evaluating men versus women. The nature of the communication itself (boasts being perceived as more masculine and positive disclosures as more feminine) may exacerbate such differential activation in the construction of \u201cmental models\u201d of another's communication.

VConfusing rotation\u2010like operations in space, mind and brain __ The research on mental rotation is now extensive, and diverse in its approach and level. The phenomenon was originally described in terms of perceptual performance, and has been well replicated in that sense. That human observers can apparently turn images about axes of rotation or reflection, and correctly construct identifications of objects whose images have been transformed in a virtual mental space, is uncontested but in some ways unexplained. The phenomenon raises fundamental questions about the nature of mathematical assumptions within psychological theory, and suggests a need for the reconciliation of phenomenological, neuropsychological and mathematical descriptions within one compatible framework. It is concluded that what actually happens is not rotation in the geometrical sense but a serial operation that may be confused with rotation, and may sometimes yield the same terminal result. A bibliography of major sources on the experimental and mathematical analyses of the mental rotation of images of 2\u2010d and 3\u2010d figures has been compiled.

VThe sponsor-adopter gap\u2014differences between promoters and potential users of information systems that link organizations __ The success of interorganizational systems depends on the adoption and use of these systems. This paper suggests that one barrier to successful implementation concerns differences between sponsors (or promoters) and potential adopters (or intended users) which can delay and inhibit initial uptake of interorganizational systems. The concept of a sponsor-adopter gap is described, reasons for its existence are derived from innovation literature and ways of bridging the gap are presented. Case examples are used to help illustrate the discussion. It is argued that marketing by the sponsor and peer communication among potential adopters can help overcome the sponsor-adopter gap.

VUse of a mental rotation reaction-time paradigm to measure the effects of upper cervical adjustments on cortical processing: A pilot study __ Objectives: To investigate the potential usefulness of a mental rotation paradigm in providing an objective measure of spinal manipulative therapy. To determine if cortical processing, as indicated by response time to a mental rotation reaction-time task, is altered by an upper cervical toggle recoil adjustment. Design: Prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Chiropractic college clinical training facility. Participants: Thirty-six chiropractic student volunteers with clinical evidence of upper cervical joint dysfunction. Intervention: Participants in the experimental group received a high-velocity, low-amplitude upper cervical adjustment. A non-intervention group was used to control for improvement in the mental rotation task as a result of practice effects. Outcome measures: Reaction time was measured for randomly varying angular orientations of an object appearing either as normal or mirror-reversed on a computer screen. Results: The average decrease in mental rotation reaction time for the experimental group was 98 ms, a 14.9% improvement, whereas the average decrease in mental rotation reaction time for the control group was 58 ms, an 8.0 improvement. The difference scores after the intervention time were significantly greater for the experimental group compared with the control group, as indicated by a one-tailed, 2-sample, equal variance Student t test, (P < 05). Conclusion: The results of this study have demonstrated a significant improvement in a complex reaction-time task after an upper cervical adjustment. These results provide evidence that upper cervical adjustment may affect cortical processing. (J Manipulative Physiol Ther 2000;23:246\u201351)

VTouching Up Mental Rotation: Effects of Manual Experience on 6\u2010Month\u2010Old Infants\u2019 Mental Object Rotation __ In this study, 6\u2010month\u2010olds' ability to mentally rotate objects was investigated using the violation\u2010of\u2010expectation paradigm. Forty infants watched an asymmetric object being moved straight down behind an occluder. When the occluder was lowered, it revealed the original object (possible) or its mirror image (impossible) in one of five orientations. Whereas half of the infants were allowed to manually explore the object prior to testing, the other half was only allowed to observe the object. Results showed that infants with prior hands\u2010on experience looked significantly longer at the mirror image, while infants with observational experience did not discriminate between test events. These findings demonstrate that 6\u2010month\u2010olds' mental rotations benefit from manual exploration, highlighting the importance of motor experience for cognitive performance.

VArterial Closing Pressure Correlates With Diastolic Pseudohypertension in the Elderly __ Background. Pseudohypertension has frequently been reported in the elderly population, with the diastolic measurement being the most frequent source of error. There is no satisfactory noninvasive method of calculating the error in the blood pressure reading. We investigated the role of arterial closing pressure in the diagnosis of diastolic pseudohypertension. Methods. Indirect and direct blood pressure were measured in 24 elderly patients. Brachial artery closure was visualized by ultrasound in all subjects. Arterial closing pressure (ACP) was recorded as zero if the vessel was seen to close spontaneously when it was isolated from central arterial pressure. If the vessel did not close spontaneously, a water cuff was applied externally over the artery and the additional pressure required to close it was recorded. Results. Diastolic pseudohypertension was noted in 8 subjects. Spontaneous closure of the brachial artery occurred in the 16 without pseudohypertension; i.e., ACP = 0. Additional pressure of the water cuff (range: 30\u2013158 mm Hg) was required to collapse the artery (ACP) in those with diastolic pseudohypertension. ACP correlated with the extent of diastolic pseudohypertension (range: 5-17 mm Hg); r = .85, p < .001). Conclusion. We propose that ACP may be used to diagnose the presence and extent of pseudohypertension.

VParkinsonian patients without dementia or depression do not suffer from bradyphrenia as indexed by performance in mental rotation tasks with and without advance information __ A predominant symptom of Parkinson's disease is akinesia and bradykinesia, slowing in the initiation and execution of voluntary movement. There has long been speculation as to whether cognitive processes undergo similar processes, but findings may be confounded by the frequent co-occurrence of dementia and/or depression. Mental rotation provides an internal or cognitive analogue of real movement, and enables us to determine the speed of such mental processes independent of any concurrent motor slowing in response initiation and execution. Medicated patients with Parkinson's disease who were free of dementia and depression were found to be able to mentally rotate alphanumeric or figural stimuli, with and without advance information as to the view (front or back) of a stick figure shortly to be shown, as rapidly as normal healthy controls. We conclude that cognitive processes involved in mental rotation are not necessarily slowed in Parkinson's disease.

VBioregeneration involving a coal\u2010based adsorbent used for removing nitrophenol from water __ Char produced from low rank coal briquettes is potentially a cheap adsorbent suitable for the removal of trace levels of soluble organic compounds from water. In this study, briquette char produced from Victorian low rank coal was used to adsorb the organic compound p\u2010nitrophenol (PNP) from aqueous solution, where nitrophenol is representative of low molecular weight adsorbates. Once concentrated on the adsorbent, attempts were made to remove the PNP by desorption and biodegradation. Desorbed PNP was degraded to some degree by three bacteria (Pseudomonas putida, Arthrobacter sp., and Moraxella sp.). The rates of PNP biodegradation by the three bacteria were followed, together with the corresponding rates of formation of the nitrite ion degradation product. Evidence is presented to indicate large microbial floc particle formation for both Pseudomonas putida and Arthrobacter leads to loss of nitrite ion by denitrification. Removal of PNP from the adsorbent by desorption/biodegradation was shown to be much faster than by desorption alone, but not all nitrophenol was removed from the adsorbent by the desorption/biodegradation process. © 1998 Society of Chemical Industry

VCommunity\u2010based seroepidemiological survey of HCV infection in Catalonia, Spain __ The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against the hepatitis C virus (anti\u2010HCV) and the associated risk factors in a representative sample of the population of Catalonia, Spain. Serum samples from 2,142 subjects aged between 5 and 70 years, selected at random from urban and rural habitats, were studied. Multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine variables associated independently with the presence of HCV antibodies. The age and gender standardized prevalence of anti\u2010HCV was 2.5% (95% confidence interval, 1.8\u20133.2). Prevalence increased significantly with age (P\u2009<\u20090.001), but no other sociodemographic variables were associated with HCV infection. Tattoos (OR: 6.2), blood transfusions (OR: 5.0) intravenous drug use (OR: 4.9) and antecedents of hospitalization (OR: 2.3) were variables associated independently with infection. HCV infection affects mainly elderly people in Spain and spares children and adolescents. This suggests that major exposure to HCV may have occurred many years ago, when infection was more widespread than in recent years. J. Med. Virol. 65:688\u2013693, 2001. © 2001 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VMental rotation of objects versus hands: Neural mechanisms revealed by positron emission tomography __ Twelve right-handed men participated in two mental rotation tasks as their regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored using positron emission tomography. In one task, participants mentally rotated and compared figures composed of angular branching forms; in the other task, participants mentally rotated and compared drawings of human hands. In both cases, rCBF was compared with a baseline condition that used identical stimuli and required the same comparison, but in which rotation was not required. Mental rotation of branching objects engendered activation in the parietal lobe and Area 19. In contrast, mental rotation of hands engendered activation in the precentral gyrus (M1), superior and inferior parietal lobes, primary visual cortex, insula, and frontal Areas 6 and 9. The results suggest that at least two different mechanisms can be used in mental rotation, one mechanism that recruits processes that prepare motor movements and another mechanism that does not.

VSpatial abilities in an elective course of applied anatomy after a problem\u2010based learning curriculum __ A concern on the level of anatomy knowledge reached after a problem\u2010based learning curriculum has been documented in the literature. Spatial anatomy, arguably the highest level in anatomy knowledge, has been related to spatial abilities. Our first objective was to test the hypothesis that residents are interested in a course of applied anatomy after a problem\u2010based learning curriculum. Our second objective was to test the hypothesis that the interest of residents is driven by innate higher spatial abilities. Fifty\u2010nine residents were invited to take an elective applied anatomy course in a prospective study. Spatial abilities were measured with a redrawn Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Test in two (MRT A) and three (MRT C) dimensions. A need for a greater knowledge in anatomy was expressed by 25 residents after a problem\u2010based learning curriculum. MRT A and C scores obtained by those choosing (n = 25) and not choosing (n = 34) applied anatomy was not different (P = 0.46 and P = 0.38, respectively). Percentage of residents in each residency program choosing applied anatomy was different [23 vs. 31 vs. 100 vs. 100% in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Surgery, and Anesthesia, respectively; P < 0.0001]. The interest of residents in applied anatomy was not driven by innate higher spatial abilities. Our applied anatomy course was chosen by many residents because of training needs rather than innate spatial abilities. Future research will need to assess the relationship of individual differences in spatial abilities to learning spatial anatomy.

VThe influence of sex and empathy on putting oneself in the shoes of others __ We tested whether putting oneself in the shoes of others is easier for women, possibly as a function of individuals' empathy levels, and whether any sex difference might be modulated by the sex of presented figures. Participants (N=100, 50 women) imagined (a) being in the spatial position of front\u2010facing and back\u2010facing female and male figures (third person perspective (3PP) task) and (b) that the figures were their own mirror reflections (first person perspective (1PP) task). After mentally taking the figure's position, individuals decided whether the indicated hand of the figure would be their own left or right hand. Contrary to our hypothesis, results from the 3PP\u2010task showed higher rotational costs for women than men, suggesting that mental rotation rather than social strategies had been employed. However, faster responding by women with higher empathy scores would appear to indicate that some women engaged social perspective taking strategies irrespective of the figures' position. Figures' sex was relevant to task performance as higher rotational costs were observed for male figures in the 3PP\u2010task for both sexes and for female figures in the 1PP\u2010task for women. We argue that these latter findings indicate that performance was facilitated and/or inhibited towards figures associated with specific social and emotional implications.

VCore and Stable Sets of Large Games Arising in Economics __ It is shown that the core of a non-atomic glove-market game which is defined as the minimum of finitely many non-atomic probability measures is a von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern stable set. This result is used to characterize some stable sets of large games which have a decreasing returns to scale property. We also study exact non-atomic glove-market games. In particular we show that in a glove-market game which consists of the minimum of finitely many mutually singular non-atomic measures, the core is a von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set iff the game is exact.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: C70, C71, D24.

VStudies of self-assembled InP quantum dots in planar microcavities __ Self-assembled InP quantum dots have been grown in planar microcavities. The dots were embedded in a Ga0.52In0.48P spacer grown on top of a high reflectance epitaxial Al0.29Ga0.71As/AlAs distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) to obtain a 3\u03bb/4 cavity. The Fabry\u2013Perot microcavity is formed between the AlGaAs/AlAs DBR and a dielectric SiNx/SiO2 DBR deposited on top of the GaInP spacer. The quantum dot emission is centered at 1.62 eV at 7 K. The microcavity resonance is centered at 1.65 eV, with a linewidth of 2 meV. Micro-photoluminescence (PL) studies using different objectives with different numerical apertures enable the collection of transversal modes.

VEffects of video game playing on measures of spatial performance: Gender effects in late adolescence __ Older adolescents played the video game Tetris for a total of 6 hr each in two separate experiments. None of the subjects had had any prior experience with Tetris, a video game requiring the rapid rotation and placement of seven different-shaped blocks. In Experiment 1, subjects were pre- and posttested on paper-and-pencil measures of spatial ability. In Experiment 2, computerized measures of mental rotation and visualization skills were administered. In both studies, experimental subjects' pre-post scores were compared to pre-post scores obtained from a control sample of subjects. Results indicated that playing Tetris improves mental rotation time and spatial visualization time. Consistent with earlier research, reliable and consistent differences between males and females were only obtained on complex mental rotation tasks.

VAverage number of jets in deep inelastic scattering __ Using the recently formulated k\u22a5-clustering algorithm for lepton-hadron collisions, we compute the average number of hadronic jets produced in deep inelastic scattering, as a function of the momentum transfer Q2, the Bjorken variable x and the jet resolution parameter \u0192cut. For samll values of \u0192cut we are able to resum leading and next-to-leading logarithms of \u0192cut to all orders in QCD perturbation theory. The result is simply related to the average jet multiplicity in e+e\u2212 annihilation, with a structure-function-dependent correction. For larger values of \u0192cut we match the resummed predictions to first-order numerical results.

VAn experimental marine ecosystem study of the pelagic biogeochemistry of pentachlorophenol __ The marine biogeochemistry of pure pentachlorophenol was studied relative to a control treatment at a scale which provided a good model for the pelagic planktonic environment (70 m3 polyethylene bags). Pentachlorophenol that was dispersed at concentrations of 10 and 100 \u03bcg/litre showed identical relative rates of decrease over 25 days to concentrations 32·8% and 31·1%, respectively, of the initial concentrations. No bioaccumulation by phytoplankton or zooplankton was observed and pentachlorophenol removal by adsorption (by particulates, zooplankton or the enclosure walls) was insignificant. The log of the pentachlorophenol concentration was significantly correlated to the hours of bright sunshine up to Day 18, after which the photolysis efficiency decreased as the proportion of pentachlorophenol exposed to sunlight decreased. The results imply a long residence time for pentachlorophenol in deeper waters outside the photolysis zone. A persistent reduction in the primary production and production per unit carbon was observed at 100 \u03bcg/litre and, when coupled to the reproducible demise of the centric diatom Skeletonema costatum in culture and the spiked enclosures, suggests that pentachlorophenol inhibits phytoplankton growth.

VA Theoretical Analysis of Alignment and Edit Problems for Trees __ Abstract: The problem of comparing two tree structures emerges across a wide range of applications in computational biology, pattern recognition, and many others. A number of tree edit methods have been proposed to find a structural similarity between trees. The alignment of trees is one of these methods, introduced as a natural extension of the alignment of strings, which gives a common supertree pattern of two trees, whereas tree edit gives a common subtree pattern. It is well known that alignment and edit are two equivalent notions for strings from the computational point of view. This equivalence, however, does not hold for trees. The lack of a theoretical formulation of these notions has lead to confusion. In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis of alignment and edit methods, and show an important relationship, which is the equivalence between the the alignment of trees and a variant of tree edit, called less-constrained edit.

VHuman monoclonal islet specific autoantibodies share features of islet cell and 64 kDa antibodies __ Summary: The first human monoclonal islet cell antibodies of the IgG class (MICA 1-6) obtained from an individual with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus were cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies selected by the indirect immunofluorescence test on pancreas sections. Surprisingly, they all recognized the 64 kDa autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase. In this study we investigated which typical features of cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies are represented by these monoclonals. We show by double immunofluorescence testing that MICA 1-6 stain pancreatic beta cells which is in agreement with the beta-cell specific expression of glutamate decarboxylase. In contrast an islet-reactive IgM monoclonal antibody obtained from a pre-diabetic individual stained all islet cells but lacked the tissue specificity of MICA 1-6 and must therefore be considered as a polyreactive IgM-antibody. We further demonstrate that MICA 1-6 revealed typical features of epitope sensitivity to biochemical treatment of the target tissue which has been demonstrated for islet cell antibodies, and which has been used to argue for a lipid rather than a protein nature of target antigens. Our results provide direct evidence that the epitopes recognized by the MICA are destroyed by methanol/chloroform treatment but reveal a high stability to Pronase digestion compared to proinsulin epitopes. Conformational protein epitopes in glutamate decarboxylase therefore show a sensitivity to biochemical treatment of sections such as ganglioside epitopes. MICA 1-6 share typical features of islet cell and 64 kDa antibodies and reveal that glutamate decarboxylase-reactive islet cell antibodies represent a subgroup of islet cell antibodies present in islet cell antibody-positive sera.

VPhotoemission study of pristine and potassium intercalated benzylic amide catenane films __ In this paper we report a photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) study of films of a benzylic amide [2]catenane on Au(111). We show that this molecule retains its molecular integrity during sublimation and that it chemisorbs on the metal surface. Potassium intercalation modifies the electronic structure of the films. We have observed a reduction of its amide functions and a modification of the charge density of the aromatic rings. The creation of polaron-like states in the gap of the neutral catenane and a decrease in the catenane work function of 0.8eV have been demonstrated.

VMental rotation as a mediator for sex-related differences in visualization __ This study was designed to analyze whether Mental Rotation (MR) played a role as a mediating variable for sex-related differences in Visualization (VZ). Two psychometric tests measuring MR and VZ were applied to a representative sample of 309 males and 390 females in their last year of high school. Three non-zero correlations between sex and MR, sex and VZ, and MR and VZ were found, and the effect of sex on VZ was eliminated when MR was introduced as a covariable. When three subgroups of different VZ ability were made by dividing up the VZ distribution by the first and third quartiles, sex-differences were only found for the high-scorers group, for which previous results were replicated. Results clearly indicate that MR is a plausible mediator variable for sex differences in VZ when such differences do exist. Theoretical, methodological and practical consequences of these results are discussed.

VInfluence of Different Unifloral Honeys on Heterocyclic Aromatic Amine Formation and Overall Mutagenicity in Fried Ground\u2010beef Patties __ ABSTRACT The effects of different unifloral honeys (buckwheat, clover, and sage), carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, and sucrose), and antioxidants (vitamin E, BHT), and Trolox® (6\u2010hydroxy\u20102,5,7,8\u2010tetramethylchroman\u20102\u2010carboxylic acid) on heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) formation and overall mutagenicity in fried ground patties were evaluated. The inhibition of total HAA formation was achieved with buckwheat (55%), clover (52%), and sage (51%); and they also reduced overall mutagenicity 36, 31, and 26%, respectively. The addition of fructose, glucose, or fructose and glucose together, at levels comparable to their occurrence in honey, reduced (p < 0.05) mutagenicity and HAA formation by amounts comparable to that found with honey.

VInduction of graft versus leukemia effects by cell-mediated lymphokine-activated immunotherapy after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in murine B cell leukemia __ Abstract: \u2003The feasibility of inducing graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects with allogeneic T cells in recipients of autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was studied in a murine model (BCL\u200a1) of human B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Allogeneic cell therapy, induced by infusion with peripheral blood lymphocytes, a mixture of allogeneic spleen and lymph node cells and allogeneic activated cell therapy, induced by in vitro recombinant-interleukin-2(rIL-2)-activated allogeneic bone marrow cells in tumor-bearing mice, prevented disease development in adoptive BALB/c recipients. Concomitant in vivo activation of allogeneic lymphocytes with rIL-2 suppressed even more effectively the development of leukemia in secondary adoptive recipients of spleen cells obtained from treated mice. In contrast, in vivo administration of rIL-2 after syngeneic BMT, with or without equal numbers of syngeneic lymphocytes, led to disease development in secondary recipients. Our data suggest that effective cell therapy can be achieved after SBMT by allogeneic but not syngeneic lymphocytes and that anti-leukemic effects induced by allogeneic lymphocytes can be further enhanced by in vitro or in vivo activation of allogeneic effector cells with rIL-2. Therefore, cell therapy by allogeneic lymphocytes following autologous BMT could become an effective method for inducing GVL-like effects on minimal residual disease provided that graft versus host disease can be prevented or adequately controlled.

VMental transformations in the motor cortex __ The behavioral and neural correlates of processing of motor directional information are described for two visuomotor tasks: mental rotation and context-recall. Psychological studies with human subjects suggested that these two tasks involve different time-consuming processes of directional information. Analyses of the activity of single cells and neuronal populations in the motor cortex of behaving monkeys performing in the same tasks provided direct insight into the neural mechanisms involved and confirmed their different nature. In the mental rotation task the patterns of neuronal activity revealed a rotation of the intended direction of movement. In contrast, in the context-recall task the patterns of neural activity identified a switching process of the intended direction of movement.

VThe Timing of Temporoparietal and Frontal Activations During Mental Own Body Transformations from Different Visuospatial Perspectives __ The perspective from where the world is perceived is an important aspect of the bodily self and may break down in neurological conditions such as out-of-body experiences (OBEs). These striking disturbances are characterized by disembodiment, an external perspective and have been observed after temporoparietal damage. Using mental own body imagery, recent neuroimaging work has linked perspectival changes to the temporoparietal cortex. Because the disembodied perspective during OBEs is elevated in the majority of cases, we tested whether an elevated perspective will interfere with such temporoparietal mechanisms mental own body imagery. We designed stimuli of life-sized humans rotated around the vertical axis and rendered as if viewed from three different perspectives: elevated, lowered, and normal. Reaction times (RTs) in an own body transformation task, but not the control condition, were dependent on the rotation angle. Furthermore, RTs were shorter for the elevated as compared with the normal or lowered perspective. Using high-density EEG and evoked potential (EP) mapping, we found a bilateral temporoparietal and frontal activation at ~330\u2013420 ms after stimulus onset that was dependent on the rotation angle, but not on the perspective. This activation was also found in response-locked EPs. In the time period ~210\u2013330 ms we found a temporally distinct posterior temporal activation with its duration being dependent on the perspective, but not the rotation angle. Collectively, the present findings suggest that temporoparietal and frontal as well as posterior temporal activations and their timing are crucial neuronal correlates of the bodily self as studied by mental imagery.

VRecognition of unfamiliar faces in prosopagnosia __ Prosopagnosia is clinically defined as a specific and extreme inability to recognize familiar faces. However, doubts have been expressed concerning prosopagnosics' preserved ability to recognize unfamiliar faces and to make other within category discriminations. The present study pursues these doubts. If recognition of unfamiliar faces and objects is intact, then prosopagnosics should demonstrate normal processing for all tasks that depend on the possession of intact stored visual descriptions at the category level. In particular, they should show normal face and object superiority effects. A detailed investigation was carried out on a well documented prosopagnosic (KD) and less extensively on three other (RB, AH and OA) well attested cases. Experiments 1 and 2 considered whether face and object superiority effects were observed in these patients. No difference in the pattern of recognition performance was found between normal and unusual arrangements of faces and objects. Their pattern of performance differed both from unilateral brain-damaged patients and normal controls. The results suggest both that these prosopagnosic patients were impaired on the recognition of unfamiliar faces and that their problem is not specific to faces. Experiment 3 showed that KD was impaired on a face/non-face decision task but appeared to benefit by the stimulus being presented in the normal orientation. For normal controls, mental rotation of a face appeared to be a separate process from face categorization. Experiment 4 found that KD, AH and OA were impaired, compared to normal controls, in their ability to recognize emotional expressions but not more than brain-damaged controls. The impairment of the prosopagnosics tested in the present study is placed at the interaction between stored object descriptions and the structural encoding stage of Bruce and Young. Consideration is given to an elaboration of the structural encoding stage in which boundary (category defining) information is separately processed from surface (detailed texture) information.

VSex differences in spatial abilities of medical graduates entering residency programs __ Sex differences favoring males in spatial abilities have been known by cognitive psychologists for more than half a century. Spatial abilities have been related to three\u2010dimensional anatomy knowledge and the performance in technical skills. The issue of sex differences in spatial abilities has not been addressed formally in the medical field. The objective of this study was to test an a priori hypothesis of sex differences in spatial abilities in a group of medical graduates entering their residency programs over a five\u2010year period. A cohort of 214 medical graduates entering their specialist residency training programs was enrolled in a prospective study. Spatial abilities were measured with a redrawn Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Tests in two (MRTA) and three (MRTC) dimensions. Sex differences favoring males were identified in 131 (61.2%) female and 83 (38.8%) male medical graduates with the median (Q1, Q3) MRTA score [12 (8, 14) vs. 15 (12, 18), respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.0001] and MRTC score [7 (5, 9) vs. 9 (7, 12), respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.0001]. Sex differences in spatial abilities favoring males were demonstrated in the field of medical education, in a group of medical graduates entering their residency programs in a five\u2010year experiment. Caution should be exerted in applying our group finding to individuals because a particular female may have higher spatial abilities and a particular male may have lower spatial abilities.

VDental school admissions in Ireland: can current selection criteria predict success? __ Introduction: Entry into university education in Ireland, including dental school, is based solely on academic performance in the Leaving Certificate Examination, held at the end of formal school education. The aim of this investigation was to examine the suitability of this process for the selection of dental students in Ireland. Materials and methods: Information for all dental students who entered the dental degree programme immediately following completion of the Leaving Certificate Examination at the National University of Ireland, Cork, during the years 1997\u20131999 was retrieved. Information was collected relating to gender, the number of times the student had attempted the Leaving Certificate Examination, their performance in this examination, the total number of marks awarded to each student at the end of the First and Final Dental Examinations, and their performance in individual modules. Results: Whilst there was a significant relationship between performance in the Leaving Certificate Examination and the First Dental Examination (correlation coefficient 1/4 0.22, P < 0.05), this relationship could only explain 12% of the variation within the performance of students in this examination. There was no relationship between performance in the Leaving Certificate and the Final Dental Examination (correlation coefficient 1/4 0.09, P > 0.05). There was a significant correlation between performance in the Leaving Certificate Examination and performance in seven of the 55 programme modules, all of which were preclinical modules, and of which five were related to basic sciences. Conclusions: Based on the limitations of this study, the current selection process for dental students in Ireland seems to be of limited value.

VThe inadequacies of contemporary oropharyngeal suction __ Airway management is the highest priority in any resuscitation. Suction equipment capable of rapidly clearing the oropharynx is mandatory for airway management. Inadequate oropharyngeal suction with standard equipment may be associated with major complications in emergency airway management. We report cases that illustrate the inadequacies of standard suction equipment. Available oropharyngeal aspirators and their limitations are discussed. Recent advances in the field of oropharyngeal suction also are described.

VAutomatic generation of Japanese\u2013English bilingual thesauri based on bilingual corpora __ The authors propose a method for automatically generating Japanese\u2013English bilingual thesauri based on bilingual corpora. The term bilingual thesaurus refers to a set of bilingual equivalent words and their synonyms. Most of the methods proposed so far for extracting bilingual equivalent word clusters from bilingual corpora depend heavily on word frequency and are not effective for dealing with low\u2010frequency clusters. These low\u2010frequency bilingual clusters are worth extracting because they contain many newly coined terms that are in demand but are not listed in existing bilingual thesauri. Assuming that single language\u2010pair\u2010independent methods such as frequency\u2010based ones have reached their limitations and that a language\u2010pair\u2010dependent method used in combination with other methods shows promise, the authors propose the following approach: (a) Extract translation pairs based on transliteration patterns; (b) remove the pairs from among the candidate words; (c) extract translation pairs based on word frequency from the remaining candidate words; and (d) generate bilingual clusters based on the extracted pairs using a graph\u2010theoretic method. The proposed method has been found to be significantly more effective than other methods.

VToward a chronopsychophysiology of mental rotation __ In a parity judgment task, the ERPs at parietal electrode sites become the more negative the more mental rotation has to be executed. In two experiments, it was investigated whether a temporal relationship exists between the onset of this amplitude modulation and the moment when mental rotation is executed. Therefore, the duration of processing stages located before mental rotation was manipulated. The amplitude modulation was delayed when either the perceptual quality of the stimulus was reduced (Experiment 1) or when character discrimination was more difficult (Experiment 2). The results suggest that the onset of the rotation\u2010related negativity might be used as a chronopsychophysiological marker for the onset of the cognitive process of mental rotation.

VModeling bacterial survival in unfavorable environments __ Summary: The long-term survival of pathogenic microorganisms was evaluated and modeled in simulated fermented and dried, uncooked sausages, such as salami and pepperoni.Listeria monocytogenes andSalmonella were inoculated in BHI broths with added lactic acid or lactate (0\u20131.5%), NaCl (0\u201319%) and NaNO2 (0\u2013200 ppm) and then incubated at 4\u201342°C for up to 9 months. Enumerations of surviving cells showed several forms of declining curves, including classic first-order declines, shoulder or lag phases, and two-phase declines with shoulder. Two primary models were tested for their ability to depict the data. The effect of the environmental conditions on the parameters of the models were described with multiple regression equations (secondary models).

VMental rotation versus invariant features in object perception from different viewpoints: an fMRI study __ It has been proposed that object perception can proceed through different routes, which can be situated on a continuum ranging from complete viewpoint-dependency to complete viewpoint-independency, depending on the objects and the task at hand. Although these different routes have been extensively demonstrated on the behavioral level, the corresponding distinction in the underlying neural substrate has not received the same attention. Our goal was to disentangle, on the behavioral and the neurofunctional level, a process associated with extreme viewpoint-dependency, i.e. mental rotation, and a process associated with extreme viewpoint-independency, i.e. the use of viewpoint-invariant, diagnostic features. Two sets of 3-D block figures were created that either differed in handedness (original versus mirrored) or in the angles joining the block components (orthogonal versus skewed). Behavioral measures on a same\u2013different judgment task were predicted to be dependent on viewpoint in the rotation condition (same versus mirrored), but not in the invariance condition (same angles versus different angles). Six subjects participated in an fMRI experiment while presented with both conditions in alternating blocks. Both reaction times and accuracy confirmed the predicted dissociation between the two conditions. Neurofunctional results indicate that all cortical areas activated in the invariance condition were also activated in the rotation condition. Parietal areas were more activated than occipito-temporal areas in the rotation condition, while this pattern was reversed in the invariance condition. Furthermore, some areas were activated uniquely by the rotation condition, probably reflecting the additional processes apparent in the behavioral response patterns.

VNewly proposed hybrid resonant commutation bridge\u2010leg link snubber\u2010assisted three\u2010phase ZVZCS\u2010PWM soft\u2010switching inverter __ This paper presents the newly proposed hybrid resonant commutation bridge\u2010leg link (HRCB) snubber circuit which can achieve zero voltage and zero current soft\u2010switching commutation for single\u2010phase and three\u2010phase voltage source\u2010type inverter, along with its unique features and operation principle. The circuit parameter design approach for the HRCB snubber circuit and the determination estimating scheme of the gate pulse timing processing which is more suitable and acceptable for single\u2010phase and space voltage vector modulated three\u2010phase voltage source inverter using the HRCB snubber circuit are described in this paper. In particular, the three\u2010phase voltage source soft\u2010switching inverter associated with the proposed HRCB circuits are evaluated and discussed from simulation and experimental viewpoints. The practical effectiveness of the HRCB snubber\u2010assisted three\u2010phase voltage source soft\u2010switching inverter using IGBT power modules which is based on the instantaneous space voltage vector modulation is clarified on the output voltage waveform, actual efficiency of electromagnetic noise in comparison with three\u2010phase voltage source\u2010type conventional hard\u2010switching inverter. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VAlcohol intoxication effects on visual perception: An fMRI study __ We examined the effects of two doses of alcohol (EtOH) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation during a visual perception task. The Motor\u2010Free Visual Perception Test\u2013Revised (MVPT\u2010R) provides measures of overall visual perceptual processing ability. It incorporates different cognitive elements including visual discrimination, spatial relationships, and mental rotation. We used the MVPT\u2010R to study brain activation patterns in healthy controls (1) sober, and (2) at two doses of alcohol intoxication with event\u2010related fMRI. The fMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model approach based upon a model of the time course and a hemodynamic response estimate. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed to examine dose\u2010dependent amplitude changes. With regard to alcohol\u2010free task\u2010related brain activation, we replicate our previous finding in which SPM group analysis revealed robust activation in visual and visual association areas, frontal eye field (FEF)/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the supplemental motor area (SMA). Consistent with a previous study of EtOH and visual stimulation, EtOH resulted in a dose\u2010dependent decrease in activation amplitude over much of the visual perception network and in a decrease in the maximum contrast\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (in the lingual gyrus). Despite only modest behavior changes (in the expected direction), significant dose\u2010dependent activation increases were observed in insula, DLPFC, and precentral regions, whereas dose\u2010dependent activation decreases were observed in anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus, and middle frontal areas. Some areas (FEF/DLPFC/SMA) became more diffusely activated (i.e., increased in spatial extent) at the higher dose. Alcohol, thus, appears to have both global and local effects upon the neural correlates of the MVPT\u2010R task, some of which are dose dependent. Hum.

VLearning anatomy enhances spatial ability __ Spatial ability is an important factor in learning anatomy. Students with high scores on a mental rotation test (MRT) systematically score higher on anatomy examinations. This study aims to investigate if learning anatomy also oppositely improves the MRT\u2010score. Five hundred first year students of medicine (n = 242, intervention) and educational sciences (n = 258, control) participated in a pretest and posttest MRT, 1 month apart. During this month, the intervention group studied anatomy and the control group studied research methods for the social sciences. In the pretest, the intervention group scored 14.40 (SD: ± 3.37) and the control group 13.17 (SD: ± 3.36) on a scale of 20, which is a significant difference (t\u2010test, t = 4.07, df = 498, P < 0.001). Both groups show an improvement on the posttest compared to the pretest (paired samples t\u2010test, t = 12.21/14.71, df = 257/241, P < 0.001). The improvement in the intervention group is significantly higher (ANCOVA, F = 16.59, df = 1;497, P < 0.001). It is concluded that (1) medical students studying anatomy show greater improvement between two consecutive MRTs than educational science students; (2) medical students have a higher spatial ability than educational sciences students; and (3) if a MRT is repeated there seems to be a test effect. It is concluded that spatial ability may be trained by studying anatomy. The overarching message for anatomy teachers is that a good spatial ability is beneficial for learning anatomy and learning anatomy may be beneficial for students' spatial ability. This reciprocal advantage implies that challenging students on spatial aspects of anatomical knowledge could have a twofold effect on their learning.

VA full electromagnetic CAD tool for microwave devices using a finite element method and neural networks __ A relevant automated electromagnetic (EM) optimization method is presented. This optimization method combines a rigorous and accurate global EM analysis of the device performed with a finite element method (FEM) and a fast analytical model deducted from its segmented EM analysis applying a neural network approximation. First we present our optimization tools, then we describe our full EM optimization method with the definition of the analytical model. Afterward, we apply it to optimize three volumetric dielectric resonator (DR) filters, considering the novel topology of the dual\u2010mode filter. The accuracy of this automated method is demonstrated considering the good agreement between theoretical optimization results and experimental ones. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It is suggested that the quality of the implementation of a selection procedure when there is local latitude in its implementation is an important factor in determining the procedure's effectiveness.

VA Reply to Halpern's Commentary: Theory-Driven Methods for Classifying Groups Can Reveal Individual Differences in Spatial Ability within Females __ In Halpern's commentary, she strongly supports our theoretical and methodological framework for addressing the ways in which biological and environmental factors interact to influence spatial ability in females (see my review in this issue). I have reanalyzed a data set using two classification methods, to address Halpern's specific criticism that another researcher (McKeever, 1991) has found a pattern of results different from ours. The right-handed females from a suburban high school sample were given the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, and a family handedness questionnaire. When these females were divided into familial handedness subgroups based on the criteria used by McKeever, no significant differences were obtained. However, using a theory-driven classification system based on Annett's genetic theory, I found significantly reduced spatial ability among the predicted subgroup of right-handed females. In this reply: (1) I also address Halpern's main criticism regarding the genetic basis of handedness (which is the underlying assumption of Annett's theory), and (2) I have described a mechanism which may account for the impact of both genetic and environmental factors on individual differences in handedness and pattern of fetal brain development.

VAnalysis of the Money Road-Map Test performance in normal and brain-damaged subjects __ The Money Road-Map Test (MRMT) is a paper and pencil assessment of left-right discrimination. Some of the answers require an egocentric mental rotation in space. In a first experiment with 63 normal adults, we found that the accuracy and speed of the left-right decision process significantly decreased with a increasing degree of mental rotation required. A division of the MRMT turns in three categories with increasing mental rotation was proposed. In a second study (n = 50), patients with predominantly parietal brain lesions performed significantly worse than patients with predominantly frontal lesions. The significant group difference in total error score was especially due to the error scores of turns requiring mental rotation. The turn type analysis did not contribute to the lateralization of the lesions.

VTraining-related changes in solution strategy in a spatial test __ Item response models were used to study changes in strategy use in a spatial task induced by a mental rotation training. Application of the Linear Logistic Model with Relaxed Assumptions (LLRA) showed differential training-related improvement in different item types, with the strongest improvement in items requiring spatial cognition. Application of Mixed Rasch Models (MRM) showed two latent classes of participants at pretest\u2014one using a spatial strategy, the other using a pattern comparison strategy. Theoretical strategy classifications showed that the training caused almost all participants who used the pattern strategy at pretest to shift to a spatial strategy. Results are discussed both from a substantive and from a methodological perspective.

VImpact of practice on speed of mental rotation __ We tested 11- and 20-year-olds on 3360 trials of a mental rotation task in which they judged if stimuli presented in different orientations were letters or mirror images of letters. Children's and adults' processing times decreased substantially over practice. These changes were well characterized by hyperbolic and power functions in which most of the parameters of those functions were constrained to adults' values. Performance on two transfer tasks, mental rotation of letter-like characters and memory search for numbers, indicated that the practiced skill did not generalize to other domains. The results are discussed in terms of different mechanisms that might be responsible for the impact of practice.

VScreening for large bowel neoplasms in individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer __ Logistical problems associated with population screening for colorectal cancer are identified and the possibility of targeting screening to those with a familial predisposition to the disease is discussed. Evidence for a substantial genetic eflect on the overall incidence of colorectal cancer is reviewed. The screening detection rate of colorectal neoplasms in relatives of patients with colorectal cancer has been shown to be higher than that expected in a non\u2010selected population; the evidence that polypectomy will reduce future colorectal cancer risk in such individuals is explored. Recent advances in the molecular genetics of colorectal cancer susceptibility are reviewed; it is possible that a genetic test might be developed in the future which could identify at least a proportion of those at risk. Excluding financial considerations, the risk\u2010benefit ratio of colonoscopy in a screened population is intimately related to the remaining risk of colorectal cancer in those who undergo the examination. At present, patients undergoing colonoscopy to investigate a positive faecal occult blood (FOB) test as part of a population\u2010based screening programme include individuals with a familial predisposition as well as those without. About 20 per cent of all cases of colorectal cancer are associated with an obvious genetic predisposition, and the risk of cancer in their relatives is high. Because false positives occur with Haemoccult, the residual risk to the population who are FOB positive but do not have a familial trait may be suflciently low that the dangers of colonoscopy could outweigh the potential benefits. Scotland has a high incidence of colorectal cancer, and analysis of recent Scottish incidence data shows an actuarial lifetime risk of developing this disease of one in 23 for men and one in 33 for women. As a family history of the disease increases that risk by two to four times and the neoplasms arise throughout the colon in such a group, there may be a case for oflering colonoscopy to all first\u2010degree relatives of those under 50 years of age at diagnosis, if not of all index cases of colorectal cancer.

VLearning Map Interpretation: Skill Acquisition and Underlying Abilities __ The effectiveness of the Map Interpretation and Terrain Association Course (MITAC) was evaluated. MITAC instruction significantly improved subjects' ability to perform terrain association, a critical skill in position location. In addition, individual differences in spatial abilities were assessed to identify cognitive components underlying map interpretation. Two components, orientation and mental rotation, were found to be equally important for predicting real world position location, while orientation alone was related to course success. Comparison of experimental and control groups' spatial aptitude scores indicated that the success of MITAC in improving terrain association was not a result of increased spatial aptitude. Instead, the course was effective because it taught a procedural orientation strategy that can be learned by those with low spatial ability. Finally, field and classroom performance were compared to wayfinding in a virtual (video game) environment in which position coordinates were available during play. Game performance was significantly related to both field and classroom performance, and to spatial aptitude.

VLateral domain heterogeneity in cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine monolayers as a function of cholesterol concentration and phosphatidylcholine acyl chain length __ Mixed monolayers of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholines having symmetric, different length acyl chains (10 to 16 carbons each) were prepared at the air/water interface. The partitioning of a fluorescent probe, NBD-cholesterol at 0.5 mol%, among lateral domains was determined by epifluorescence microscopy. The mixed monolayers had cholesterol concentrations of 20, 25, or 33 mol%, and in all these monolayers, lateral domain heterogeneity was observed within a defined surface pressure interval. This surface pressure interval was highly influenced by the phosphatidylcholine acyl chain length, but not by the cholesterol content of the mixed monolayer. The characteristic surface pressure, at which the line boundary between expanded and condensed phases dissolved (phase transformation pressure), and the monolayer entered an apparent phase-miscible state, was about 20 mN/m for di10PC and decreased as a linear function of the phosphatidylcholine acyl chain length to be about 2.5 mN/m for di16PC. During initial compression of the monolayers, the sizes of the condensed phases were generally larger, and to some extent heterogeneous with respect to the size distribution, as compared to the situation in monolayers which had experienced a compression/expansion cycle, which took them above the phase transformation pressure. This suggest that the domains observed during initial compression were not equilibrium structures. This study has demonstrated that both the cholesterol content and the phosphatidylcholine acyl chain length markedly influenced the properties of laterally condensed domains in these mixed monolayers. Since the possibility for the formation of attractive van der Waals forces between cholesterol and acyl chains increase with increasing acyl chain length, and since the phosphocholine head group is similar in all systems examined, the observed differences in domain shapes, properties, and stability most likely resulted from differences in van der Waals forces.

VAnterior protrusion of retroperitoneal processes a mimic of lesser sac or gastrohepatic masses __ The space between the left lobe of the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach normally contains intraperitoneal structures. These include the gastrohepatic recess of the greater peritoneal cavity, the medial recess of the lesser sac and the interposed gastrohepatic ligament. An anterior protrusion of retroperitoneum can project into this space, dorsal to the posterior reflection of the medial compartment of the lesser sac. Tumors that extend into this fossa are anterior and medial to the fundic and upper body region of the stomach. These tumors may cause confusion regarding their origin if the radiologist is not aware of the existence of this retroperitoneal protrusion. Between 1982, and 1986, 183 patients with pancreatic cancer were hospitalized at our institution, 63 of whom had computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen. Four of these patients (6.3%) demonstrated direct tumor extension anterior to the stomach. During this same period, four large benign retroperitoneal tumors also exhibited this finding. Masses in the gastrohepatic interval between the liver and stomach can be extensions of retroperitoneal processes and should not be assumed to represent intraperitoneal involvement.

VMultiresidue analytical method of pesticides in peanut oil using low\u2010temperature cleanup and dispersive solid phase extraction by GC\u2010MS __ A method for the determination of 33 pesticides in peanut oil by GC\u2010MS was described. Two extraction procedures based on (i) low\u2010temperature extraction and (ii) liquid\u2013liquid extraction were tested for the optimization of the method. The mixture of anhydrous MgSO4 with primary secondary amine (PSA) or with PSA and C18 was performed as sorbents in dispersive SPE. Low temperature along with PSA and C18 cleanup gave the best results. Pesticides were identified and quantified by GC\u2010MS in SIM mode. The correlation coefficients, R2, in the linear range tests were better than 0.990. The average recoveries for most pesticides (spiked at 0.02, 0.05, 0.2, and 1 mg/kg) ranged from 70 to 110%, the RSD was below 20% in most instances, and LODs varied from 0.5 to 8 \u03bcg/kg.

VA comparative study of the selectivity and efficiency of target tissue uptake of five tritium-labeled androgens in the rat __ A comparative study of the tissue distribution of five tritium-labeled androgens was done in rats to determine the efficiency and selectivity of their uptake by target tissue. Testosterone (T), 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 19-nortestosterone (nor-T), mibolerone (Mib) and methyltrienolone (R1881) all showed selective uptake by the ventral prostate in one-day castrated rats (250 g) that was 61\u201390% displaceable by co-injection of an excess of unlabeled steroid. The greatest uptake was with R1881 (0.69% injected dose per gram prostate tissue (%ID/g) at 1 h), and Mib (0.56% ID/g); the other three showed lower uptake (approx. 0.4% ID/g). The target tissue activity remained high for all compounds up to 4 h after injection, and at 2\u20134 h the prostate to blood ratio for Mib and R1881 exceeded 10 and 20, respectively. The uptake efficiency and selectivity of these five androgens appear to be related to their affinity for the androgen receptor and their resistance to metabolism. Mib and R1881 have substantial affinity for other steroid receptors, which might account for some of their prostate uptake. However, co-administration of triamcinolone acetonide, which has high affinity for progesterone and corticosteroid receptors but not for the androgen receptor, failed to block their uptake significantly, whereas co-administration of DHT, the most selective ligand for the androgen receptor, blocked their uptake as completely as the unlabeled tracer itself. The prostate uptake of Mib and R1881 in intact animals was significantly lower than in castrated animals, but treatment of the intact animals with diethylstilbestrol restored their uptake nearly to the level seen in castrated animals. These uptake patterns are consistent with earlier studies of in vivo androgen uptake and with known changes in androgen receptor content and occupancy as a result of castration or diethylstilbestrol treatment. They further suggest that high affinity androgens labeled with suitable radionuclides\u2014particularly derivatives of mibolerone (Mib) or methyltrienolone (R1881)\u2014may be effective receptor-based imaging agents for androgen target tissues and tumors, even when patients are already receiving hormonal therapy.

VHow special are brightest group and cluster galaxies? __ We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to construct a sample of 625 brightest group and cluster galaxies (BCGs) together with control samples of non-BCGs matched in stellar mass, redshift and colour. We investigate how the systematic properties of BCGs depend on stellar mass and on their privileged location near the cluster centre. The groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the C4 catalogue of Miller et al. but we have developed improved algorithms for identifying the BCG and for measuring the cluster velocity dispersion. Since the SDSS photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of large galaxies in dense environments, we have developed a correction for this effect which can be readily applied to the published catalogue data. We find that BCGs are larger and have higher velocity dispersions than non-BCGs of the same stellar mass, which implies that BCGs contain a larger fraction of dark matter. In contrast to non-BCGs, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of BCGs does not vary as a function of galaxy luminosity. Hence BCGs lie on a different Fundamental Plane than ordinary elliptical galaxies. BCGs also follow a steeper Faber\u2013Jackson relation than non-BCGs, as suggested by models in which BCGs assemble via dissipationless mergers along preferentially radial orbits. We find tentative evidence that this steepening is stronger in more massive clusters. BCGs have similar mean stellar ages and metallicities to non-BCGs of the same mass, but they have somewhat higher \u03b1/Fe ratios, indicating that star formation may have occurred over a shorter time-scale in the BCGs. Finally, we find that BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud active galactic nuclei than other galaxies of the same mass, but are less likely to host an optical active galactic nucleus (AGN). The differences we find are more pronounced for the less massive BCGs, i.e. they are stronger at the galaxy group level.

VIs there an effect of weightlessness on mental rotation of three-dimensional objects? __ We studied the performance of eight cosmonauts in a mental rotation paradigm with simultaneously presented perspective views of three-dimensional objects. The cosmonauts were tested successively on earth, in microgravity aboard the Russian MIR station and again on earth. Their performance was compared to performance of a control group of five subjects tested on earth on the same dates. We particularly tried to disambiguate the effect of microgravity, procedural bias and practice. Our results show that the microgravity did not alter the mental rotation process. The performance of cosmonauts increased with practice, similarly to the performance of control group's subjects suggesting that the weightlessness did not impair implicit learning as well. Finally, we propose an explanation of previous contradictory results.

VInfectious Encephalitis in France in 2007: A National Prospective Study __ Background. Encephalitis is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, but its cause remains largely unknown. We designed a national prospective study in France in 2007 to describe patients with encephalitis, investigate the etiologic diagnosis of encephalitis, and assess risk factors associated with death. Methods. Patients were enrolled by attending physicians according to case definition, and data were collected with a standardized questionnaire. The etiologic diagnosis was investigated after a standardized procedure. Risk factors associated with death during hospitalization were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Results. A total of 253 patients with acute infectious encephalitis from 106 medical units throughout France were included in the study. Their ages ranged from 1 month to 89 years (median age, 54 years); 61% were male. Cause of the encephalitis was determined in 131 patients (52%). Herpes simplex virus 1 (42%), varicella-zoster virus (15%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (15%), and Listeria monocytogenes (10%) were the most frequently identified agents. Twenty-six patients (10%, all adults) died, 6 of them with tuberculosis and 6 with listeriosis. Risk factors independently associated with death during hospitalization identified by the multivariable analysis were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0\u20131.4; for 5-year increase), cancer (OR, 17; 95% CI, 2.3\u2013122.6), immunosuppressive treatment before onset (OR, 24; 95% CI, 1.3\u2013426.0), percentage of hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4\u20133.0; for 10% increase), the etiologic agent, coma on day 5 after admission (OR, 16; 95% CI, 2.8\u201392.3), and sepsis on day 5 after admission (OR, 94; 95% CI, 4.9\u20131792.2). Conclusions. Our prospective study provides an overview of the clinical and etiologic patterns of acute infectious encephalitis in adults in France. Herpes simplex virus 1 remains the main cause of encephalitis, but bacteria accounts for the highest case-fatality rates.

VPattern analysis of the variation in the sensitivity of aquatic species to toxicants __ Our aim in this study was to identify groups of species showing a similar pattern in their sensitivity to toxicants and to relate the patterns to the mode of toxic action and biological species characteristics. A data matrix was composed of acute toxicity data for 26 aquatic species and 21 compounds. Most of the variation in the toxicological data was due to differences in toxicity of compounds and not intrinsic differences between species, so that practically every species can be used to order compounds with respect to average toxicity. Compounds with high overall toxicity also had large interspecies variation in sensitivity. The toxicity of non-polar narcotics correlated well with the log KOW. Compounds with a specific or reactive mode of action were more than a factor 10 toxic than predicted by their log KOW. Patterns in species sensitivity were more diffuse because only part of the variance in species sensitivity could be explained. Fishes and amphibians were more sensitive to dieldrin, lindane and pentachlorophenol than were invertebrates. Among the arthropods, the Phyllopoda (daphnids) were the most sensitive species. They were very sensitive to aniline, the heavy metals, malathion and parathion.

VImpossible \u201cmental rotation\u201d problems __ Current textbooks report that men's visual\u2013spatial skills are superior to women's. However, the research is not consistent with this sweeping generalization. We hypothesized that sex differences would be more pronounced on \u201cimpossible problems\u201d (mirror images) than possible rotations. We also hypothesized that males' performance would be adversely affected by visual interference, whereas females' performance would be adversely affected by auditory interference. Ninety-five college students (25 males, 70 females) viewed images of a train station from various perspectives, including some that were impossible rotations of the original image. There were no sex differences in accuracy or response time on the possible rotation problems, but males were more accurate than females on impossible problems. Neither auditory nor visual interference affected accuracy. The alleged sex difference in mental rotation problems is largely due to the use of problems that are not actually mental rotation problems.

VPreparation Techniques for the Injection of Human Autologous Cartilage: An Ex Vivo Feasibility Study __ Objectives: To determine the optimum donor site and preparation technique for injecting human autologous cartilage as a potentially permanent implant material for vocal fold medialization. Study Design: Prospective ex vivo experimental model. Methods: Human nasal septal and auricular cartilage was obtained from eight surgical cases after institutional review board approval. The auricle and nasal septum were chosen as potential donor sites because of ease of accessibility, volume of cartilage potentially available, and minimal subsequent cosmetic deformity after the tissue harvesting procedure. Various preparation techniques readily available in most operating rooms were tested for their efficacy in generating an injectable cartilage slurry. The various cartilage slurries were injected through sequentially smaller needles and examined cytologically. Results: The best injection properties for both nasal septal and auricular cartilage were obtained by drilling the cartilage down with a 5 mm otologic cutting bur, which allowed free passage through an 18 gauge needle. Cytologic examination of drilled septal cartilage showed good uniformity of cartilage pieces with a mean largest dimension of 0.44 ± 0.33 mm, and 33% of lacunae contained viable\u2010appearing chondrocytes. Cytologic examination of drilled auricular cartilage was similar, exceptonly 10% of lacunae were occupied by chondrocytes. Other techniques tested (knife, morselizer, and cartilage crusher) did not yield injectable cartilage slurries. Conclusions: Both nasal septal and auricular cartilage can be prepared for injection via an 18 gauge needle using a cutting otologic bur. Further testing of in vivo viability and long\u2010term volume retention is needed.

VRegional cerebral blood flow and extraversion __ Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was examined in a group of 17 subjects (8 men, 9 women, ages 22\u201335 years) at rest and during three mental activations, inducing perceptual and spatial processing. The subjects completed two personality questionnaires, the Eysenck Personality Inventory and the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). The aim of the study was to examine the relation between rCBF and the extraversion-introversion dimension. Earlier studies of rCBF at rest have found higher blood flow in the temporal lobes for introverts than for extraverts, and a negative correlation between extraversion and global CBF among women. Both findings were confirmed in this group. The importance of related personality dimensions, such as impulsivity and anxiety, for rCBF differences between extraverts and introverts were examined, using scales from the KSP questionnaire. It was found that anxiety-proneness aspects of introversion were more importnat in determining high temporal blood flow than low-impulsivity aspects. Global CBF in women, as a measure of general arousal, was mainly related to the sensation-seeking aspects of extraversion. Results from the spatial processing tasks showed more right-hemispheric activation for introverts than extraverts in a mental rotation task.

VMasculinizing effects on otoacoustic emissions and auditory evoked potentials in women using oral contraceptives __ The otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) measured in two separate large scale studies were examined retrospectively for potential differences between those women using, and those not using, oral contraception (OC). Fourteen dependent variables were examined, all of which exhibited substantial sex differences. For 13 of those 14 dependent variables, the means for the users of OC were shifted away from the means of the non-users in the direction of the males. Specifically, for four different measures of OAE strength, for seven of eight measures of AEP latency or amplitude, and for two cognitive tests (mental rotation and water level), the means for the users of OC were located intermediate to those of the non-users of OC and the males. Few of these differences between users and non-users of OC achieved statistical significance, but the near universality of the direction of the difference suggests that oral contraceptives do produce a weak masculinizing effect on some auditory structures. These weak masculinizing effects appear to run contrary to the facts that the levels of both free testosterone and estradiol are lower in women using OC than in normal-cycling women. Past findings on auditory sex differences may have underestimated those sex differences.

VThe role of meaning and familiarity in mental transformations __ Eighty-four participants mentally rotated meaningful and meaningless objects. Within each type of object, half were simple and half were complex; the complexity was the same across the meaningful and meaningless objects. The patterns of errors were examined as a function of the type of stimuli (meaningful vs. meaningless), complexity, and angle of rotation. The data for the meaningful objects showed steeper slopes of rotation for complex objects than that for simple objects. In contrast, the simple and complex meaningless objects showed comparable increases in error rates as a function of angle of rotation. Furthermore, the slopes remained comparable after pretraining that increased familiarity with the objects. The results are discussed in terms of underlying representations of meaningful and meaningless objects and their implications to mental transformations. The data are consistent with a piece-meal rotation of the meaningful stimuli and a holistic rotation of the meaningless stimuli.

VNeurobiological differences in mental rotation and instrument interpretation in airline pilots __ Airline pilots and similar professions require reliable spatial cognition abilities, such as mental imagery of static and moving three-dimensional objects in space. A well-known task to investigate these skills is the Shepard and Metzler mental rotation task (SMT), which is also frequently used during pre-assessment of pilot candidates. Despite the intuitive relationship between real-life spatial cognition and SMT, several studies have challenged its predictive value. Here we report on a novel instrument interpretation task (IIT) based on a realistic attitude indicator used in modern aircrafts that was designed to bridge the gap between the abstract SMT and a cockpit environment. We investigated 18 professional airline pilots using fMRI. No significant correlation was found between SMT and IIT task accuracies. Contrasting both tasks revealed higher activation in the fusiform gyrus, angular gyrus, and medial precuneus for IIT, whereas SMT elicited significantly stronger activation in pre- and supplementary motor areas, as well as lateral precuneus and superior parietal lobe. Our results show that SMT skills per se are not sufficient to predict task accuracy during (close to) real-life instrument interpretation. While there is a substantial overlap of activation across the task conditions, we found that there are important differences between instrument interpretation and non-aviation based mental rotation.

VMotor and Visual Imagery as Two Complementary but Neurally Dissociable Mental Processes __ Recent studies indicate that covert mental activities, such as simulating a motor action and imagining the shape of an object, involve shared neural representations with actual motor performance and with visual perception, respectively. Here we investigate the performance, by normal individual and subjects with a selective impairment in either motor or visual imagery, of an imagery task involving a mental rotation. The task involved imagining a hand in a particular orientation in space and making a subsequent laterality judgement. A simple change in the phrasing of the imagery instructions (first-person or third-person imagery) and in actual hand posture (holding the hands on the lap or in the back) had a strong impact on response time (RT) in normal subjects, and on response accuracy in brain-damaged subjects. The pattern of results indicates that the activation of covert motor and visual processes during mental imagery depends on both top-down and bottom-up factors, and highlights the distinct but complementary contribution of covert motor and visual processes during mental rotation.

VVerbal and spatial functions during different phases of the menstrual cycle __ Background: It has been reported that high levels of sex hormones improve the efficiency in tasks which are usually better performed by females. In contrast, in tasks which are usually better performed by males, the best efficiency corresponds to low levels of sex hormones. The aim of this study was to examine changes of efficiency in tasks of verbal fluency and mental rotations, as well as changes in masculinity and femininity during the menstrual cycle. Subjects and methods: Seventeen female subjects with a regular menstrual cycle took part in the study. For assesssments of masculinity and femininity, the subjects filled the Bem's Sex Roles Inventory. Endler\u2019s Anxiety Scale was used for determining the autonomic-emotional and cognitive-worry components of anxiety. Subjects performed the verbal fluency task and mental rotations tasks during the menstrual and the early follicular phase, as well as during the pre-ovulation and the midluteal phase. Results: The results showed the best performance in mental rotation tasks which included rotations of three-dimensional objects along x and y axis during the phases of menstrual cycle, which are characterized by a low level of sex hormones. The most pronounced during these phases was also the masculinity. Furthermore, the best performance in verbal fluency task occurred during the menstrual and midluteal phase. Anxiety and femininity did not change across the menstrual cycle. Conclusion: Low levels of sex hormones potentiated the typical male cognitive profile.

VMental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects __ The time required to recognize that two perspective drawings portray objects of the same three-dimensional shape is found to be (i) a linearly increasing function of the angular difference in the portrayed orientations of the two objects and (ii) no shorter for differences corresponding simply to a rigid rotation of one of the two-dimensional drawings in its own picture plane than for differences corresponding to, a rotation of the three-dimensional object in depth.

VPerceptual Cognitive Universals as Reflections of the World __ The universality, invariance, and elegance of principles governing the universe may be reflected in principles of the minds that have evolved in that universe-provided that the mental principles are formulated with respect to the abstract spaces appropriate for the representation of biologically significant objects and their properties. (1) Positions and motions of objects conserve their shapes in the geometrically fullest and simplest way when represented as points and connecting geodesic paths in the six-dimensional manifold jointly determined by the Euclidean group of three-dimensional space and the symmetry group of each object. (2) Colors of objects attain constancy when represented as points in a three-dimensional vector space in which each variation in natural illumination is cancelled by application of its inverse from the three-dimensional linear group of terrestrial transformations of the invariant solar source. (3) Kinds of objects support optimal generalization and categorization when represented, in an evolutionarily shaped space of possible objects, as connected regions with associated weights determined by Bayesian revision of maximum·entropy priors.

VHow crawling and manual object exploration are related to the mental rotation abilities of 9-month-old infants __ The present experiment examined whether the mental rotation ability of 9-month-old infants was related to their abilities to crawl and manually explore objects. Forty-eight 9-month-old infants were tested; half of them had been crawling for an average of 9.3 weeks. The infants were habituated to a video of a simplified Shepard\u2013Metzler object rotating back and forth through a 240° angle around the longitudinal axis of the object. They were tested with videos of the same object rotating through a previously unseen 120° angle and with a mirror image of the display. All of the infants also participated in a manual object exploration task, in which they freely explored five toy blocks. The results showed that the crawlers looked significantly longer at the novel (mirror) object than at the familiar object, independent of their manual exploration scores. The non-crawlers looking times, in contrast, were influenced by the manual exploration scores.The infants who did not spontaneously explore the toy blocks tended to show a familiarity preference, whereas those who explored the toy blocks preferred to look at the novel object. Thus, all of the infants were able to master the mental rotation task but it seemed to be the most complex process for infants who had no crawling experience and who did not spontaneously explore objects.

VThe Effectiveness of Training Mental Rotation and Laparoscopic Surgical Skills in a Virtual Environment __ Current research in the area of medical simulation is investigating the efficacy of using virtual reality surgical simulators as a means of training surgical skills. More recently, medical simulation has focused on the use of virtual reality to train laparoscopic skills. Several traditional methods of training laparoscopic skills exist (e.g., pelvic trainers, video trainers, animal trainers). However, the medical community is now shifting its attention toward higher fidelity simulations and virtual reality in particular for a number of reasons. Simulations provide a quicker, more cost-effective method for training and practicing surgical skills. In addition, simulators minimize the amount of physical space required for training. Nonetheless, it has been reported that the transfer of training rate from a medical simulator was only approximately 38%. Therefore, there has been a movement to refine medical simulations by focusing on improving design and haptic technology. Current simulators utilize high-level graphics to more realistically simulate deformable tissues in order to improve visualization of organ properties. In addition, they employ force feedback in order to give the simulation a more genuine haptic performance. Both visualization of organ properties and realistic haptic feedback are characteristics lacking in traditional mechanical trainers.

VOrientation-invariant  of training in the identification of rotated natural objects __ The effects of stimulus orientation on naming were examined in two experiments in which subjects identified line drawings of natural objects following practice with the objects at the same or different orientations. Half the rotated objects were viewed in the orientation that matched the earlier presentations, and half were viewed at an orientation that mismatched the earlier presentations. Systematic effects of orientation on naming time were found during the early presentations. These effects were reduced during later presentations, and the size of this reduction did not depend on the orientation in which the object had been seen originally. The results are consistent with a dual-systems model of object identification in which initially large effects of disorientation are the result of a normalization process such as mental rotation, and in which attenuation of the effects is due to a shift from the normalization system to a feature/part-based system.

VThe athletes' body shapes the athletes' mind - new perspectives on mental rotation performance in athletes __ Mentally rotating the image of an object is one fundamental cognitive ability in humans. Recent theoretical developments and empirical evidences highlight the potential role of the sensory-motor system, when analysing and understanding mental rotation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of specific sensory-motor experience on mental rotation performance in gymnasts. N = 40 male gymnasts with either clockwise or anticlockwise rotation preference in a forward twisting layout salto performed a psychometric mental rotation test with either rotation-preference congruent or rotation-preference incongruent stimuli. Results revealed that choice reaction times differed clearly as a function of Angular Rotation between the stimuli figures. Gymnasts who preferred a clockwise rotation preference showed faster choice reaction times when the rotation direction of the reference figure was clockwise, and vice versa. The results clearly support the notion, that mental rotation performance varies as a function of sensory-motor system characteristics between different people. It is concluded, that sensory-motor experience in a particular sport may facilitate cognitive processing of experience-congruent stimuli. This may be advantageous for situations in which people are engaged in observing sport performance (i.e., judges, coaches). This conclusion could furthermore contribute to the training of athletes from sports such as sky-diving, scuba-diving, and climbing, where losses of spatial orientation can be life-threatening

VReliabilities of Mental Rotation Tasks: Limits to the Assessment of Individual Differences __ Mental rotation tasks with objects and body parts as targets are widely used in cognitive neuropsychology. Even though these tasks are well established to study between-groups differences, the reliability on an individual level is largely unknown. We present a systematic study on the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of individual differences in mental rotation tasks comparing different target types and orders of presentations. In total n = 99 participants (n = 63 for the retest) completed the mental rotation tasks with hands, feet, faces, and cars as targets. Different target types were presented in either randomly mixed blocks or blocks of homogeneous targets. Across all target types, the consistency (split-half reliability) and stability (test-retest reliabilities) were good or acceptable both for intercepts and slopes. At the level of individual targets, only intercepts showed acceptable reliabilities. Blocked presentations resulted in significantly faster and numerically more consistent and stable responses. Mental rotation tasks-especially in blocked variants-can be used to reliably assess individual differences in global processing speed. However, the assessment of the theoretically important slope parameter for individual targets requires further adaptations to mental rotation tests.

VDifferent mental rotation strategies reflected in the rotation related negativity __ In a mental rotation task of objects, typically, reaction time (RT) increases and the rotation related negativity (RRN) increases in amplitude with increasing angles of rotation. However, in a mental rotation task of hands, different RT profiles can be observed for outward and inward rotated hands. In the present study, we examined the neurophysiological correlates of these asymmetries in the RT profiles. We used a mental rotation task with stimuli of left and right hands. In line with previous studies, the behavioral results showed a linear increase in RT for outward rotations, but not for inward rotations as a function of angular disparity. Importantly, the ERP results revealed an RRN for outward rotated stimuli, but not for inward rotated stimuli. This is the first study to show that the behaviorally observed differences in a mental rotation task of hands is also reflected at the neurophysiological level.

VEnhancement of Mental Rotation Abilities and Its Effect on Anatomy Learning __ Background: Mental rotation (MR) is improved through practice and high MR ability is correlated to success in anatomy learning. Purposes: We investigated the effects of improving the MR ability on the Vandenberg and Kuse MR test performance and the consequences on learning functional human anatomy. Methods: Forty-eight students were assigned into three groups: MR group (16 students attending functional anatomy course and MR training), anatomy group (16 students attending the same functional anatomy course), and the control group (n = 16). Instead of MR training, the latter 2 groups were engaged in physical activities for an equivalent time, and the control group did not attend anatomy course. Results: MR group performed better than the two others in the MR test and better than the anatomy group in the anatomy test. Conclusions: The MR training sessions were found to improve MR test performance and were further transferred to anatomy learning.

VA dissociation between mental rotation and perspective-taking spatial abilities __ Recent psychometric results [Mem. Cogn. 29 (2001) 745] have supported a distinction between mental abilities that require a spatial transformation of a perceived object (e.g., mental rotation) and those that involve imagining how a scene looks like from different viewpoints (e.g., perspective taking). Two experiments provide further evidence for and generalize this dissociation. Experiment 1 shows that the separability of mental rotation and perspective taking is not dependent on the method by which people are tested. Experiment 2 generalizes the distinction to account for perspective taking within perceived small-scale and imagined large-scale environments. Although dissociable, measures of perspective taking and mental rotation are quite highly correlated. The research suggests some reasons why psychometric studies have not found strong evidence for the separability of the spatial visualization and spatial orientation factors, although a strong dissociation between tasks that are dependent on mental rotation and perspective-taking processes has been found in the experimental cognitive literature.

VAn Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior __ The processes which are involved in perceiving other individuals,their behavior and their personal qualities, have received but little attention in psychological literature.' Although these processes are basic in almost any social act, few experimental investigations relating to them are to be found. It is true that there have been studies con- cerning the inference of emotions from gestures or facial change. But most of these leave the reader with a feeling of disappointment and with the conviction that facial 'expressions'-at least as taken by themselves-do not play an important role in the perception of other persons. We are usually referred to the 'importance of the situation'; but what features of the situation are of importance or how the situa- tion influences the perception are problems which are left unanswered. The reason is that research in this field has seldom been carried out from the point of view of the psychology of perception. The problem usually studied has concerned the 'correct' interpretation of expression, and not the stimulus-configurations as a determinant of interpreta- tion. The same is true of another group of related investigations which concern the correctness of our judgments of others. If processes of perception are mentioned they are treated only so far as they impair the correctness of judgment.#EOL# In the investigation of the apprehension of colors, forms, or move- ment, which has attained a more mature stage of development, ques- tions of achievement or correctness-though these still play a role of legitimate importance with some psychologists (e.g. E. Brunswik)- have largely given way to other problems. When the perception of movement is investigated, it is with the purpose of finding out which stimulus conditions are relevant in the production of phenomenal movement and of determining the influences of the surrounding field. Only when we attempt to answer these questions can we hope to deepen our insight into the processes of perception, whether of move- ment or of other human beings. The experiments on the perception of the behavior of others here reported are in method and purpose different from the investigations mentioned. In the first place, instead of presenting faces with the ex- clusion of the situation, we have presented situations and activities without the face. Secondly, our aim has not been to determine the correctness of the response but instead the dependence of the response on stimulus-configurations.

VSex differences in mental rotation with polygons of different complexity: Do men utilize holistic processes whereas women prefer piecemeal ones? __ Sex differences in mental rotation were investigated as a function of stimulus complexity with a sample size of N 1\u20444 72. Replicating earlier findings with polygons, mental rotation was faster for males than for females, and reaction time increased with more complex polygons. Additionally, sex differences increased for complex polygons. Most importantly, however, mental rotation speed decreased with increasing complexity for women but did not change for men. Thus, the sex effects reflect a difference in strategy, with women mentally rotating the polygons in an analytic, piecemeal fashion and men using a holistic mode of mental rotation.

Commentary on Jansen and Lehmann __ Athletes exhibit differences in perceptual-cognitive abilities when compared to non-athletes. Recent theoretical developments focus on the role of the athletes' body in perceptual-cognitive tasks such as mental rotation tasks. It is assumed that the degree to which stimuli in mental rotation tasks can be embodied facilitates the mental rotation process. The implications of this assumption are discussed and ideas for future research are presented.

VD2 receptor binding in dopa\u2010responsive dystonia __ We have studied dopamine D2 receptor binding by [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography in 14 patients with dopa\u2010responsive dystonia (DRD). Data were compared with 16 levodopa\u2010treated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 26 healthy controls. The results revealed an elevated [11C]raclopride binding index in the putamen and caudate nucleus of DRD patients compared with controls as well as significant elevation in the caudate nucleus compared with PD patients. The increase of [11C]raclopride binding may be interpreted either as reduced tracer displacement by endogenous dopamine, or as an alteration of the receptor features due to chronic dopamine deficiency. The difference in [11C]raclopride binding in DRD and PD patients in the caudate nucleus suggests that this structure may be of pathophysiological relevance in the presentation of the clinical features of both diseases.

VHand mental rotation is not systematically altered by actual body position: Laterality judgment versus same-different comparison tasks __ It is commonly believed that during mental rotation of body parts, participants tend to imagine their own body part moving toward the stimulus, thus using an egocentric strategy. Several studies have also shown that the mental rotation of hands is affected by the actual hand position, especially if the hand is kept in an awkward position. However, this hand posture effect, as well as the use of an egocentric strategy during mental rotation of body parts, is not systematic. Several experiments have demonstrated that manipulating the stimulus features or the paradigm could induce a shift to visual and allocentric strategies. Here, we studied the effects of hand posture and biomechanical constraints on one-hand mental rotation (laterality judgment task), two-hand mental rotation (same-different judgment task), and mental rotation of one or two alphanumeric symbols (control tasks). Effects of posture and biomechanical constraints were observed solely for the laterality judgment task. Response times in the same-different hand mental rotation items were influenced by the angular disparity between the stimuli. We interpreted our result as evidence of the use of different strategies for each task. Future research should focus on disentangling the exact subprocesses in which an egocentric strategy is used, in order to propose better tests for participants with motor impairments.

VContribution of trans -18\u22361 acids from dairy fat to european diets __ Abstract: Twelve commercial samples of French butter, purchased in October\u2013November, and 12 other samples, purchased in May\u2013June, were analyzed with particular attention to theirtrans-octadecenoic acid contents. The isomeric fatty acids were quantitated by a combination of gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of total fatty acids as isopropyl esters on a polar capillary column (CPSil 88) and of silver nitrate-impregnated thin-layer chromatography followed by GLC of the pooled saturated (used as internal standards) andtrans-octadecenoic acid fractions. Autumn butters contained 3.22±0.44%trans-octadecenoic acids (relative to total fatty acids), whereas those collected during the spring contained 4.28±0.47% (P<0.01). Minimum and maximum values for the two sets of butters were 2.46 (autumn) and 5.10% (spring), respectively. The annual mean value for thetrans-octadecenoic acid content in all butter samples was 3.8% of total fatty acids (ca. 2% for thetrans-11 18\u22361 acid). This value allows calculation of the daily individual intake oftrans-octadecenoic acids from dairy products by populations of member states of the European Economic Community (EEC). It varies from 0.57 g (Portugal) to 1.66 g (Denmark). The mean value for the twelve countries of the EEC is 1.16 g/person/d, which is close to data published for the United States. In France, the consumption oftrans octadecenoic acids from dairy fat is higher than that from margarines (ca. 1.5 vs. 1.1 g/person/d).

VBrain swelling after dialysis: Old urea or New Osmoles? __ The pathogenesis of brain swelling and neurological deterioration after rapid hemodialysis (dialysis disequilibrium syndrome) is controversial. The \u201creverse urea hypothesis\u201d suggests that hemodialysis removes urea more slowly from the brain than from the plasma, creating an osmotic gradient that results in cerebral edema. The \u201cidiogenic osmole hypothesis\u201d proposes that an osmotic gradient between brain and plasma develops during rapid dialysis because of newly formed brain osmoles. In this review, the experimental basis for the two hypotheses are critically examined. Based on what is known about the physiology of urea and water diffusion across the blood-brain barrier, and empiric observations of brain solute composition after experimental hemodialysis, we conclude that the \u201creverse urea hypothesis\u201d remains a viable explanation for dialysis disequilibrium and that rapid reduction of a high urea level in and of itself predisposes to this condition.

VEffect of opioid receptor antagonists on vasodilator nerve actions in the perfused rat mesentery __ Our previous work suggests that opioid peptidcs modulate sensory nerves in the perfused rat mesentery. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that opioids are involved in the ongoing regulation of sensory nerve activity using selective opioid receptor antagonists. In the presence of guancthidinc and methoxamine, transmural nerve stimulation caused a vasodilator response which was potentiated significantly by naloxonc (3 × 10 \u22123 M). However, naloxone did not affect vasodilator responses to exogenous calcitonin gene related peptide. ICI 174.864 (3 × 10\u22127 M), a selective \u03b4 receptor antagonist, had no effect on vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation. In contrast CTOP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Phc-Thr-NH2) (3 × 10\u22127 M), a selective \u03bc receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation, effects which were abolished by naloxone treatment. In preparations prctrcalcd with \u03b2-FNA (\u03b2-funaltrexaminc HCI). an irreversible \u03bc. receptor antagonist, naloxone no longer potentiated vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation. These results suggest that potentiation of vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation by naloxone may be due to blockade of \u03bc receptors, resulting in a reduced inhibitory modulation by endogenous opioids. These findings support the contention that prejunctionai opioid receptors on sensory nerves may play a role in moduluting activity of the cardiovascular system.

VPost\u2010inoculation Population Dynamics of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Associated Bacteria in Pine Wilt Disease on Pinus thunbergii __ Population dynamics of the pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (PWN) and its accompanying bacteria in non\u2010inoculated twigs along with the process of the disease was observed in Japanese black pine, Pinus thunbergii inoculated with PWN. In the non\u2010inoculated twigs, bacteria could be detected when only a few pine needles became yellow. Once most needles had turned yellow or brown, the nematode began to appear and the bacterial populations increased. At the late stages of the disease when the inoculated pine was dying and the needles were totally wilted, the populations of both nematode and bacteria started to increase rapidly. Only a few bacterial species were found at the early stages. As the disease process advanced, the bacterial populations increased rapidly in both population size and variety of the species. However, Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. sp., Pantoea sp. and Sphimgomenas pancimobilis, remained dominant.

VDefining quality at Catholic Healthcare West __ Catholic Healthcare West, a provider network that includes 48 acute-care facilities in California, Arizona, and Nevada, is reassessing its care of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Several studies have indicated that many patients with AMI and congestive heart failure do not receive appropriate medical treatment while hospitalized. In some cases, there is resistance among clinicians to change aspects of care\u2014particularly prescribing habits. We sought to improve the use of aspirin and \u03b2-blocker therapy for patients diagnosed with AMI and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure. We found the use of a registry that collects data on patients and their care and generates reports for system review is helpful in measuring improvement in delivery of care.

VSex specificity of ventral anterior cingulate cortex suppression during a cognitive task __ Ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) is a highly interconnected brain region considered to reflect the sometimes competing demands of cognition and emotion. A reciprocal relationship between vACC and dorsal ACC (dACC) may play a role in maintaining this balance between cognitive and emotional processing. Using functional MRI in association with a cognitively\u2010demanding visuospatial task (mental rotation), we found that only women demonstrated vACC suppression and inverse functional connectivity with dACC. Sex differences in vACC functioning\u2014previously described under conditions of negative emotion\u2014are extended here to cognition. Consideration of participant sex is essential to understanding the role of vACC in cognitive and emotional processing. Hum Brain Mapp, 2007. © 2007 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VAtmospheric soluble dust records from a Tibetan ice core: Possible climate proxies and teleconnection with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation __ In autumn 2005, a joint expedition between the University of Maine and the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research recovered three ice cores from Guoqu Glacier (33°34\u203237.8\u2033N, 91°10\u203235.3\u2033E, 5720 m above sea level) on the northern side of Mt. Geladaindong, central Tibetan Plateau. Isotopes (\u03b418O), major soluble ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl\u2212, NO3\u2212, SO42\u2212), and radionuclide (\u03b2\u2010activity) measurements from one of the cores revealed a 70\u2010year record (1935\u20132005). Statistical analysis of major ion time series suggests that atmospheric soluble dust species dominate the chemical signature and that background dust levels conceal marine ion species deposition. The soluble dust time series have interspecies relations and common structure (empirical orthogonal function (EOF) 1), suggesting a similar soluble dust source or transport route. Annual and seasonal correlations between the EOF 1 time series and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis climate variables (1948\u20132004) suggest that the Mt. Geladaindong ice core record provides a proxy for local and regional surface pressure. An approximately threefold decrease of soluble dust concentrations in the middle to late 1970s, accompanied by regional increases in pressure and temperature and decreases in wind velocity, coincides with the major 1976\u20131977 shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from a negative to a positive state. This is the first ice core evidence of a potential teleconnection between central Asian atmospheric soluble dust loading and the PDO. Analysis of temporally longer ice cores from Mt. Geladaindong may enhance understanding of the relationship between the PDO and central Asian atmospheric circulation and subsequent atmospheric soluble dust loading.

VREM sleep behaviour disorder in Parkinson\u2019s disease is associated with specific motor features __ Background: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is commonly associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and recent studies have suggested that RBD in PD is associated with increased cognitive impairment, waking EEG slowing, autonomic impairment and lower quality of life on mental health components. However, it is unclear whether the association of RBD in PD has implications for motor manifestations of the disease. Methods: The study evaluated 36 patients with PD for the presence of RBD by polysomnography. Patients underwent an extensive evaluation on and off medication by a movement disorders specialist blinded to the polysomnography results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, complications of therapy and response to therapy were assessed and compared using regression analysis that adjusted for disease duration and age. Results: Patients with PD and RBD were less likely to be tremor predominant (14% vs 53%; p<0.02) and had a lower proportion of their Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score accounted for by tremor (8.2% vs 19.0%; p<0.01). An increased frequency of falls was noted among patients with RBD (38% vs 7%; p\u200a=\u200a0.04). Patients with RBD demonstrated a lower amplitude response to their medication (UPDRS improvement 16.2% vs 34.8%; p\u200a=\u200a0.049). Markers of overall disease severity, quantitative motor testing and motor complications did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The presence of altered motor subtypes in PD with RBD suggests that patients with PD and RBD may have a different underlying pattern of neurodegeneration than PD patients without RBD.

The behavior of the harmonics of the induction was investigated in ac and dc fields in a wide range of temperatures and field amplitudes. From the experimental results obtained in the asymptotic case of a weak field the values of a number of quantities characterizing the low-field electrodynamics of HTSC and their temperature dependences as well as an explicit expression for the critical current density jc(H, T)= jo(T)Ho(T) [|H| + Ho(T)] were derived.

The protein environment of the single tryptophan in HSA shows a relatively low-speed DR of sub-ns characteristic time. This relaxation can be measured as a decaying red-shift of the time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra. The details of calculations of time\u2013emission matrices (TEM) and comparison to the fluorescence data of the reference solution of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide (NATA) are also presented.

VMental rotation test performances and familial sinistrality in dextrals, with special reference to the bent twig theory __ Recently, in this journal, Casey 1995 and McKeever (1996) noted that they have reached opposite conclusions regarding the effect of familial sinistrality on mental rotation ability in dextral females. Casey and colleagues concluded that those dextral women with a family history of left handedness (the FS+) are comparable to men in mental rotation ability and that the overall male superiority on such tasks is a function of the poor performances of dextral women who lack left handedness (the FS\u2212) in their families. McKeever and colleagues had come to the exact opposite conclusion. We restudied this question and eliminated three possible methodological factors that might conceivably have accounted for the different outcomes. The results of the present study failed to find any relationship of FS status to mental rotation ability. These findings raise serious questions as to the replicability of any FS status/mental rotation ability relationships.

VSensation Seeking and Spatial Ability in Athletes: an Evolutionary Account __ The aim of this study was threefold: (a) to examine sex differences in sensation seeking and spatial abilities in a sample of athlete students, (b) to explore whether measures of sensation seeking and spatial ability can be used to distinguish between athletes engaging in sports of different levels of risk, and (c) to explore the relationship between sensation seeking and spatial abilities in a sample of athlete students. A total of 201 students athletes engaged in sports of different levels of risk completed the Spatial relations test, Mental rotation test, and Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale-V. Men scored higher than women in both measures of spatial abilities and on DIS, while women scored higher than men on ES. High-risk group had higher SSS and TAS scores than low- and medium- risk groups, and low-risk group had lower DIS scores than medium- and high-risk group, but there were no differences in spatial ability among athletes engaged in sports of different levels of risk. Spatial ability correlated with sensation seeking measures in men only. The results are discussed in terms of possible common biological background of these two sex-dimorphic traits.

VFunctional MR Imaging of Vision in the Deaf __ Rationale and Objectives Early loss of a sensory modality has been associated with cortical reorganization in both animal models and humans. The purpose of this study was to map visual activation with functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to document possible developmental reorganization in the temporal lobe caused by early deafness.Materials and Methods Six prelingual, profoundly deaf subjects were compared with a similar group of six hearing subjects. Three visual tasks were performed by both groups: attention to movement in the field-of-view periphery, shape matching, and mental rotation. Echo-planar coronal MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T.Results Regions of interest encompassing the middle and posterior aspects of the superior and middle temporal gyri demonstrated a significantly (P < .05) increased activation in deaf subjects compared with hearing subjects, particularly on the right side (P < .05) and during the tasks involving motion. The most specific effect was noted during the mental-rotation task.Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that portions of the temporal lobe usually involved in auditory processing are more active during certain visual tasks in deaf compared with hearing subjects. Cortical reorganization may be an important factor in the deaf population when considering the physiology of temporal lobe lesions and predicting surgical outcomes. Functional MR imaging may be helpful during preoperative assessment in individuals with deafness.

VQuantitative analysis of the bilateral brainstem projections from the whisker and forepaw regions in rat primary motor cortex __ The whisker region in rat primary motor (MI) cortex projects to several brainstem regions, but the relative strength of these projections has not been characterized. We recently quantified the MI projections to bilateral targets in the forebrain (Alloway et al. [2009] J Comp Neurol 515:548\u2013564), and the present study extends those findings by quantifying the MI projections to bilateral targets in the brainstem. We found that both the whisker and forepaw regions in MI project most strongly to the basal pons and superior colliculus. While the MI forepaw region projects mainly to the ipsilateral basilar pons, the MI whisker region has significantly more connections with the contralateral side. This bilateral difference suggests that corticopontine projections from the MI whisker region may have a role in coordinating bilateral whisker movements. Anterograde tracer injections in MI did not reveal any direct projections to the facial nucleus, but retrograde tracer injections in the facial nucleus revealed some labeled neurons in MI cortex. The number of retrogradely labeled neurons in MI, however, was dwarfed by a much larger number of labeled neurons in the superior colliculus and other brainstem regions. Together, our anterograde and retrograde tracing results indicate that the superior colliculus provides the most effective route for transmitting information from MI to the facial nucleus. J. Comp.

VMental Rotation, Mental Representation, and Flat Slopes __ The "mental rotation" literature has studied how subjects determine whether two stimuli that differ in orientation have the same handedness. This literature implies that subjects perform the task by imagining the rotation of one of the stimuli to the orientation of the other. This literature has spawned several theories of mental representation. These theories imply that mental representations cannot be both orientation-free and handedness-specific. We present four experiments that demonstrate the contrary: mental representations can be both orientation-free and handedness-specific. In Experiment 1 we serendipitously discovered a version of R. N. Shepard and J. Metzler\u2032s (1971) "mental rotation" task in which subjects accurately discover the handedness of a stimulus without using "mental rotation," i.e., in which reaction time to compare the handedness of two forms is not a function of the angular disparity between the two forms. In Experiment 2 we generalize this finding to different experimental procedures. In Experiment 3 we replicate this finding with a much larger group of subjects. In Experiment 4 we show that when we preclude the formation of an orientation-free representation by never repeating a polygon, subjects carry out the handedness comparison task by performing "mental rotation."

VThe critical dimensions of the response-reinforcer contingency __ Two major dimensions of any contingency of reinforcement are the temporal relation between a response and its reinforcer, and the relative frequency of the reinforcer given the response versus when the response has not occurred. Previous data demonstrate that time, per se, is not sufficient to explain the effects of delay-of-reinforcement procedures; needed in addition is some account of the events occurring in the delay interval. Moreover, the effects of the same absolute time values vary greatly across situations, such that any notion of a standard delay-of-reinforcement gradient is simplistic. The effects of reinforcers occurring in the absence of a response depend critically upon the stimulus conditions paired with those reinforcers, in much the same manner as has been shown with Pavlovian contingency effects. However, it is unclear whether the underlying basis of such effects is response competition or changes in the calculus of causation.

VOccupational-type exposure tests and bronchoalveolar lavage analyses in two patients with byssinosis and two asymptomatic cotton workers __ Summary: Two workers suffering from stage III byssinosis and claiming for compensation were examined. Bronchial obstruction was present in one case. MEF25\u201375 values were significantly reduced and bronchial hyperreactivity was present in both subjects. Occupational-type exposure tests with cotton dust resulted in significant decreases in arterial oxygen pressure for more than 2 h and were associated with an obstructive ventilation pattern in one of the patients. Prolonged hypoxemia which is not paralleled by lung function changes is probably typical for byssinosis patients since we have never seen this in inhalative challenge tests with various environmental antigens and other occupational substances including flour dust. No specific IgE or IgG antibodies could be detected. In the two patients a hitherto unknown significant increase in CD23+ lymphocytes and granulocytosis were detected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Corresponding investigations in two cotton workers without any evidence of byssinosis revealed neither lung function changes after the exposure test nor striking BAL findings. Our results demonstrate the diagnostic value of specific challenge tests and BAL investigations in patients suffering from byssinosis, which is often difficult to diagnose.

VMental rotation of objects versus hands: Neural mechanisms revealed by positron emission tomography __ Twelve right\u2010handed men participated in two mental rotation tasks as their regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored using positron emission tomography. In one task, participants mentally rotated and compared figures composed of angular branching forms; in the other task, participants mentally rotated and compared drawings of human hands. In both cases, rCBF was compared with a baseline condition that used identical stimuli and required the same comparison, but in which rotation was not required. Mental rotation of branching objects engendered activation in the parietal lobe and Area 19. In contrast, mental rotation of hands engendered activation in the precentral gyrus (M1), superior and inferior parietal lobes, primary visual cortex, insula, and frontal Areas 6 and 9. The results suggest that at least two different mechanisms can be used in mental rotation, one mechanism that recruits processes that prepare motor movements and another mechanism that does not.

VEffect of water activity on hydrolytic enzyme production by Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium proliferatum during colonisation of maize __ The effect of different water availabilities (water activity, aw; 0.98\u20130.93) and time (up to 15 days) on the production of seven hydrolytic enzymes by strains of F. moniliforme and F. proliferatum during early colonisation of gamma-irradiated living maize grain were examined in this study. Both the total activity (\u03bcmol 4-nitrophenol min\u22121 g\u22121 maize) and specific activity (nmol 4-nitrophenol min\u22121 \u03bcg\u22121 protein) were quantified using chromogenic p-nitrophenyl substrates. The dominant three enzymes produced by the fungi on whole colonised maize kernels were \u03b1-d-galactosidase, \u03b2-d-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase. The other four enzymes were all produced in much lower total amounts and in terms of specific activity (\u03b2-d-fucosidase, \u03b1-d-mannosidase, \u03b2-d-xylosidase and N-acetyl-\u03b1-d-glucosaminidase), similar to that in uncolonised control maize grain. There were significant increases in the total production of the three predominant enzymes between 3\u201315 days colonisation, and between 3\u20136 days in terms of specific activity when compared to untreated controls. The total and specific activity of the \u03b1-d-galactosidase, \u03b2-d-glucosidase and N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase, were maximum at 0.98 aw with significantly less being produced at 0.95 and 0.93 aw, with the exception of the total activity of \u03b1-d-galactosidase which was similar at both 0.95 and 0.93 aw. Single factors (time, aw, and inoculation treatment), two- and three- way interactions were all statistically significant for the three dominant enzymes produced except for specific activity of \u03b2-d-glucosidase (two and three-way interactions) and for total activity of \u03b1-d-galactosidase in the time ×aw treatment. This study suggests that these hydrolytic enzymes may play an important role in enabling these important fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. to rapidly infect living maize grain over a wide aw range.

VMental rotation may underlie apparent object-based neglect __ Previous investigations have suggested that object-based neglect may reflect an impairment in attentional allocation that occurs relative to the intrinsic left and right of objects. We report a patient with apparent \u201cobject-based\u201d neglect of 90° rotated stimuli for whom the pattern of neglect was a function of task strategy. When the patient was instructed to visualize the rotated stimuli as if they were upright, i.e. mentally rotate them, he showed apparent \u201cobject-based\u201d neglect to the left of the principal axes of the stimuli. In contrast, when instructed to refrain from mental rotation, neglect was apparent only with respect to his left, but not the left of the stimuli. Thus, the apparent \u201cobject-based\u201d neglect of this patient may be attributed to a process of mental rotation of objects to upright, and subsequent neglect in viewer-centered or environment-centered coordinates. These data suggest a mechanism whereby object-based and viewer/environment-centered reference frames may be aligned, thereby causing viewer/environment-centered neglect to appear as if object-based.

VEffects of estrogen changes during the menstrual cycle on spatial performance __ Four sequential, interrelated studies of the relationship of menstrual cycle phase to three-dimensional mental rotations performance were conducted, using both between-and within-subjects designs. All studies showed significant increases in mean mental rotations scores during the menstrual period phase, when estrogen levels were at their lowest. Effects occurred only for mental rotations; relationships with hormonal status did not occur for control tests, which were not of a spatial nature, and a different spatial test (Space Relations). Findings are discussed as they relate to ontogenetic development and evolutionary origins of sex-specific differences in spatial behaviors.

VFactors affecting the occupation of a colony site in Sydney, New South Wales by the Grey\u2010headed Flying\u2010fox Pteropus poliocephalus (Pteropodidae) __ Previous authors have reported that Pteropus poliocephalus colony sites are occupied in response to blossom availability. However, in the present study it is reported that at the Gordon site in suburban Sydney, colony numbers were negatively correlated with the occurrence of pollen in the droppings. In addition, in contrast to reported occupational patterns at other colony sites, where flying\u2010foxes are not present at the site during winter and early spring, the Gordon site was occupied by substantial numbers of flying\u2010foxes throughout the entire period of 62 months from 1985 to 1990. As a result of the introduction of plants native to other parts of Australia and exotics from other continents, there is a variety of foods available throughout the year in the Sydney region, in comparison with less urbanized areas. This food supply permits the occupation of the Gordon colony site during winter and spring and reduces the migratory behaviour of flying\u2010foxes throughout the year. It is concluded that in the absence of a restrictive food supply, the occupational pattern of the Gordon colony of P. poliocephalus is the result of the reproductive requirements of the species modified by the vagaries of blossom production in the native forests outside the foraging range of the colony.

VPhylogenetic systematics of the Empis (Coptophlebia) hyalea\u2010group (Insecta: Diptera: Empididae) __ Six clades are inferred from a phylogenetic analysis including 42 species belonging to the Empis (Coptophlebia) hyalea\u2010group.

The E.\u2003(C.)\u2003hyalea\u2010group is firstly recorded from the Palaearctic Region and Australia. Finally, the distribution and the habitats of the species compared with their phylogeny suggest a possible relationship between the diversification of the group and forest fragmentations during the Quaternary.\u2003© 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 145, 339\u2013391.

VSporting Achievement: What Is the Contribution of Digit Ratio? __ ABSTRACT Second\u2010to\u2010fourth digit ratio, a marker for prenatal testosterone levels, has been shown to be associated with sporting achievement in men. It is unclear, however, whether digit ratio makes a contribution over and above salient personality variables. The present study, which included female participants, measured four personality traits and one cognitive ability (mental rotation) that have been linked to both sports achievement and sex. The significant relationship between digit ratio and sporting achievement was nearly identical in women and men. A multiple regression showed that when significant correlates of sporting ability (weight, height, years playing, hours per week training, social potency, and mental rotation) were entered first, the contribution of digit ratio remained highly significant. We suggest that physiological as well as psychological factors may be an important avenue for future study.

VComparison of Clinical Benefits and Outcome in Patients with Programmable and Nonprogrammable Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators __ Technological advances in implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have provided a variety of programmable parameters and antitachycardia therapies whose utility and impact on clinical outcome is presently unknown. ICDs have capabilities for cardioversion defibrillation alone (first generation ICDs), or in conjunction with demand ventricular pacing (second generation ICDs), or with demand pacing and antitachycardia pacing (third generation ICDs). We examined the pattern of antitachycardia therapy use and long\u2010term survival in 110 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Group I included 62 patients with nonprogrammable first generation ICDs that delivered committed shock therapy after ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection based on electrogram rate and/or morphology was satisfied. Group II included 48 patients with multiprogrammable ICDs (including second and third generation ICDs) that had programmable tachyarrhythmia detection based on rate and tachycardia confirmation prior to delivery of electrical treatment with either programmable shocks and/or, as in the third generation ICDs, antitachycardia pacing. Incidence and patterns of antitachycardia therapy use and long\u2010term survival were compared in the two groups. The incidence of appropriate shocks in patients who completed 1 year of follow\u2010up was significantly greater in group I (30 of 43 patients = 70% vs 11 of 26 patients = 42%; P < 0.05). In the total follow\u2010up period, a significantly larger proportion of group I patients as compared to group II patients used the shock therapies (46 of 62 patients = 74% vs 25 of 48 patients = 52%; P < 0.01), with the majority doing so within the first year of implantation (96% and 92%, respectively). Although the frequency of antitachycardia therapy activation was similar, the number of shocks delivered per patient was lower in group II, particularly in the initial 3 months of follow\u2010up (P = 0.06). No clinical variable aided in identifying users from nonusers of antitachycardia therapy. Arrhythmic mortality was virtually eliminated in both groups. Two\u2010year actuarial cardiac survival in the two groups was similar (group I = 78% vs group II = 84%; P < 0.2J. Survival from cardiac mortality in users and nonusers of antitachycardia therapies was also similar in both groups (P < 0.2) and in the total patient group (P < 0.2). We conclude that programmable ICDs continue to confer advantages in prevention of sudden death that were observed with nonprogrammable ICDs and can be expected to improve patient tolerance and physician acceptance of device therapy for VT/VF.

VComputer visualizations: Factors that influence spatial anatomy comprehension __ Computer visualizations are increasingly common in education across a range of subject disciplines, including anatomy. Despite optimism about their educational potential, students sometime have difficulty learning from these visualizations. The purpose of this study was to explore a range of factors that influence spatial anatomy comprehension before and after instruction with different computer visualizations. Three major factors were considered: (1) visualization ability (VZ) of learners, (2) dynamism of the visual display, and (3) interactivity of the system. Participants (N = 60) of differing VZs (high, low) studied a group of anatomical structures in one of three visual conditions (control, static, dynamic) and one of two interactive conditions (interactive, non\u2010interactive). Before and after the study phase, participants' comprehension of spatial anatomical information was assessed using a multiple\u2010choice spatial anatomy task (SAT) involving the mental rotation of the anatomical structures, identification of the structures in 2D cross\u2010sections, and localization of planes corresponding to given cross\u2010sections. Results indicate that VZ had a positive influence on SAT performance but instruction with different computer visualizations could modulate the effect of VZ on task performance.

VEstrogen and Memory in a Transsexual Population __ The association between administered estrogen and performance on verbal memory and other cognitive tasks was examined. Male-to-female transsexuals undergoing estrogen treatment for sex reassignment (n= 29) scored higher on Paired Associate Learning (PAL) compared to a similar transsexual control group, awaiting estrogen treatment (n= 30) (P< 0.05). No differences between groups receiving and not receiving estrogen were detected on a control memory task (Digit Span) or on other cognitive tasks including Mental Rotations and Controlled Associations. There were no group differences in age. Group differences in mood or in general intellectual ability also did not explain the findings. Results suggest a specific influence of estrogen in men on verbal memory tasks, similar to that seen in prior studies of women. They are discussed in terms of differential processing demands of the two memory tasks and possible differences between estrogenic influences on Mental Rotations and Controlled Associations in men versus women.

VEvidence accumulation in cell populations responsive to faces: an account of generalisation of recognition without mental transformations __ In this paper we analyse the time course of neuronal activity in temporal cortex to the sight of the head and body. Previous studies have already demonstrated the impact of view, orientation and part occlusion on individual cells. We consider the cells as a population providing evidence in the form of neuronal activity for perceptual decisions related to recognition. The time course of neural responses to stimuli provides an explanation of the variation in speed of recognition across different viewing circumstances that is seen in behavioural experiments. A simple unifying explanation of the behavioural effects is that the speed of recognition of an object depends on the rate of accumulation of activity from neurones selective for the object, evoked by a particular viewing circumstance. This in turn depends on the extent that the object has been seen previously under the particular circumstance. For any familiar object, more cells will be tuned to the configuration of the object's features present in the view or views most frequently experienced. Therefore, activity amongst the population of cells selective for the object's appearance will accumulate more slowly when the object is seen in an unusual view, orientation or size. This accounts for the increased time to recognise rotated views without the need to postulate `mental rotation' or `transformations' of novel views to align with neural representations of familiar views.

VAnalysis of the Money Road-Map Test performance in normal and brain-damaged subjects __ The Money Road-Map Test (MRMT) is a paper and pencil assessment of left-right discrimination. Some of the answers require an egocentric mental rotation in space. In a first experiment with 63 normal adults, we found that the accuracy and speed of the left-right decision process significantly decreased with a increasing degree of mental rotation required. A division of the MRMT turns in three categories with increasing mental rotation was proposed. In a second study (n = 50), patients with predominantly parietal brain lesions performed significantly worse than patients with predominantly frontal lesions. The significant group difference in total error score was especially due to the error scores of turns requiring mental rotation. The turn type analysis did not contribute to the lateralization of the lesions.

VGender, level of spatial ability, and lateralization of mental rotation __ The present study indicates that some of the inconsistencies in studies of the lateralization of mental rotation may be a consequence of uncontrolled individual differences in the general level of spatial ability. In order to investigate the relation between spatial ability and the lateralization of mental rotation, 48 subjects (24 males and 24 females) were divided into three groups based on their performance on a standardized test of spatial ability. They then performed a lateralized two-dimensional mental rotation task. The results showed the typical mental rotation function in that angle of rotation and reaction time were linearly related. A significant spatial ability by visual field interaction indicated that subjects with low spatial ability had a left field advantage, whereas subjects with medium spatial ability showed no field advantage and subjects with high spatial ability showed a right field advantage. Gender also interacted with visual field, with males showing a left visual superiority and females an insignificant right visual field advantage. A significant three-way interaction of gender, spatial ability, and angle of rotation reflected the fact that low spatial males were more profoundly affected by rotation than the other groups. The results suggest that at least some of the inconsistent findings in studies of lateralization of mental rotation may be accounted for by differences in the level of spatial ability.

VDetection of antibodies to Candida albicans germ tube as a possible aid in diagnosing systemic candidiasis in bone marrow transplant patients __ Abstract: Indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect antibodies toCandida albicans blastospore and germ tube were performed in sera of 29 bone marrow transplant patients. Antibodies to germ tube were present in the sera of six patients, in four of whom aCandida albicans infection was highly probable, while in the other two patients it was not possible to determine the previous course. No healthy blood donors had these antibodies. On the other hand, detection of antibodies toCandida albicans blastospore showed low specificity in the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis. These preliminary findings suggest that the detection of antibodies toCandida albicans germ tube may be an important aid in the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis in bone marrow transplant patients.

VWomen who excel on a spatial task: Proposed genetic and environmental factors __ A \u201cbent twig\u201d model which incorporates Annett's genetic handedness theory with an environmental component predicted characteristics of college women likely to excel on a mental rotation task. Those likely to have the necessary combination of genetic potential and prior experiences are right-handed women with non-right-handed relatives who rate themselves high in spatial experiences. This subgroup significantly outperformed all other groups of right-handed women on the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test. This study provides support for the view that family handedness and spatial experiences are important factors influencing mental rotation ability in women.

VWhere Vision Meets Memory: PrefrontalPosterior Networks for Visual Object Constancy during Categorization and Recognition __ Objects seen from unusual relative to more canonical views require more time to categorize and recognize, and, according to object model verification theories, additionally recruit prefrontal processes for cognitive control that interact with parietal processes for mental rotation. To test this using functional magnetic resonance imaging, people categorized and recognized known objects from unusual and canonical views. Canonical views activated some components of a default network more on categorization than recognition. Activation to unusual views showed that both ventral and dorsal visual pathways, and prefrontal cortex, have key roles in visual object constancy. Unusual views activated object-sensitive and mental rotation (and not saccade) regions in ventrocaudal intraparietal, transverse occipital, and inferotemporal sulci, and ventral premotor cortex for verification processes of model testing on any task. A collaterallingual sulci place area activated for mental rotation, working memory, and unusual views on correct recognition and categorization trials to accomplish detailed spatial matching. Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and object-sensitive lateral occipital sulcus activated for mental rotation and unusual views on categorization more than recognition, supporting verification processes of model prediction. This visual knowledge framework integrates vision and memory theories to explain how distinct prefrontalposterior networks enable meaningful interactions with objects in diverse situations.

VCasein phosphopeptides enhance paracellular calcium absorption but do not alter temporal blood pressure in normotensive rats __ Casein phosphopeptides (CPP) were purified from an in vitro tryptic digestion of casein and used for in vitro calcium binding affinity experiments to determine the optimal binding characteristics of CPP. These studies were followed by animal feeding trials designed to examine the absorption of 45Ca from the distal part of the small intestine. Male Wistar rats were meal-fed isonitrogenous diets containing casein, whey protein, soy protein isolate (SPI) or a milk protein concentrate (MPC) with adequate dietary calcium (0.7%) for a 10-week period. The absorption of 45Ca was measured from the disappearance of 45Ca from a ligated ileum loop. There were no differences in body weight gain or plasma Ca, Mg, K, Na and Ca+2 between animal groups fed the different protein sources. The 45Ca absorption from the ileum was significantly (P<0.05) lower in SPI than casein or MPC fed rats. Similarly, the apparent absorption of 40Ca was also significantly (P<0.05) higher in casein and MPC fed animals than both the SPI and whey protein-fed counterparts. These results were supported by a relatively higher amount of organic phosphorus recovered from ligated ileal loops of both casein and MPC fed animals. Despite the apparent enhancement in paracellular calcium absorption in casein and MPC groups, no differences in either systolic or mean blood pressures of rats fed the selected dietary proteins were observed.

VTHE DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF BONE SCAN IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL CELL CARCINOMA __ Purpose Bone scan is performed as part of the evaluation of bone metastasis. We assessed the diagnostic value of bone scan in patients with renal cell carcinoma.Materials and Methods Bone scan was performed at presentation in 205 patients with confirmed renal cell carcinoma. Abnormal hot areas were further evaluated by x-ray, computerized tomography or surgery.Results Of the 56 patients (27) with an abnormal bone scan 32 (57) had osseous metastatic lesions. Overall bone metastasis was present in 34 of the 205 patients (17). Bone scan had 94 sensitivity and 86 specificity. Of the 124 patients with clinically localized, stages T1-2N0M0 disease exclusive of bone metastasis 6 (5) had bone metastasis only, whereas 28 of 81 (35) with locally advanced or metastatic disease had bone metastasis, including 12 (35) who complained of bone pain and 19 (56) who presented with other symptoms due to local tumor growth or metastasis at other sites. Three patients (9) were asymptomatic. There was osseous metastasis without other metastasis, enlarged regional lymph nodes or bone pain in 7 patients, including 1 with stage T1b (2 of all with that stage), 2 with stage T2 (5), 1 with stage T3a (4), 1 with stage T3b (6), 1 with stage T3c (14) and 1 with stage T4 (6) disease.Conclusions Bone scan may be omitted in patients with stages T1-3aN0M0 tumors and no bone pain because of the low proportion of missed cases with bone metastasis.

VGlucagon effects on brain carbohydrate and ketone body metabolism of rainbow trout __ The levels of glycogen in brain, lactate and acetoacetate in brain and plasma, glucose in plasma and the activities of brain key enzymes of glycogen metabolism (glycogen phosphorylase, GPase, glycogen synthetase, GSase), gluconeogenesis (fructose 1,6\u2010bisphosphatase, FBPase), and glycolysis (6\u2010phosphofructo 1\u2010kinase, PFK) were evaluated in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, from 0.5 to 3 hr after intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml/kg\u20131 body weight of saline alone (controls) or containing bovine glucagon at three different doses: 10, 50, and 100 ng/g\u20131 body weight. The results obtained demonstrate, for the first time in a teleost fish, the existence of changes in brain carbohydrate and ketone body metabolism following peripheral glucagon treatment. A clear stimulation of brain glycogenolytic potential was observed after glucagon treatment, as judged by the time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent changes observed in brain glycogen levels (up to 88% decrease), and GPase (up to 30% increase) and GSase (up to 42% decrease) activities. In addition, clear time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent increased and decreased levels were observed in brain of glucagon\u2010treated rainbow trout for lactate (up to 60% increase) and acetoacetate (up to 67% decrease), respectively. In contrast, no significant changes were observed after glucagon treatment in those parameters related to glycolytic/gluconeogenic capacity of rainbow trout brain. Altogether, these in vivo results suggest that glucagon may play a role (direct or indirect) in the regulation of carbohydrate and ketone body metabolism in brain of rainbow trout. J. Exp.

VSpatial ability in secondary school students: Intra\u2010sex differences based on self\u2010selection for physical education __ Past research has demonstrated consistent sex differences with men typically outperforming women on tests of spatial ability. However, less is known about intra\u2010sex effects. In the present study, two groups of female students (physical education and non\u2010physical education secondary students) and two corresponding groups of male students explored a large\u2010scale virtual shopping centre. In a battery of tasks, spatial knowledge of the shopping centre as well as mental rotation ability were tested. Additional variables considered were circulating testosterone levels, the ratio of 2D:4D digit length, and computer experience. The results revealed both sex and intra\u2010sex differences in spatial ability. Variables related to virtual navigation and computer ability and experience were found to be the most powerful predictors of group membership. Our results suggest that in female and male secondary students, participation in physical education and spatial skill are related.

VExternal Accumulation of Ions for Enhanced Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry __ Electrospray ionization (ESI) in combination with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry provides for mass analysis of biological molecules with unrivaled mass accuracy, resolving power and sensitivity. However, ESI FTICR MS performance with on-line separation techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis has to date been limited primarily by pulsed gas assisted accumulation and the incompatibility of the associated pump-down time with the frequent ion beam sampling requirement of on-line chromatographic separation. Here we describe numerous analytical advantages that accrue by trapping ions at high pressure in the first rf-only octupole of a dual octupole ion injection system before ion transfer to the ion trap in the center of the magnet for high performance mass analysis at low pressure. The new configuration improves the duty cycle for analysis of continuously generated ions, and is thus ideally suited for on-line chromatographic applications. LC/ESI FTICR MS is demonstrated on a mixture of 500 fmol of each of three peptides. Additional improvements include a fivefold increase in signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power compared to prior methods on our instrument.

VMedial temporal lobe activations in fMRI and PET studies of episodic encoding and retrieval __ Early neuroimaging studies often failed to obtain evidence of medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation during episodic encoding or retrieval, but a growing number of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have provided such evidence. We review data from fMRI studies that converge on the conclusion that posterior MTL is associated with episodic encoding; too few fMRI studies of retrieval have reported MTL activations to allow firm conclusions about their exact locations. We then turn to a recent meta\u2010analysis of PET studies (Lepage et al., Hippocampus 1998;8:313\u2013322) that appears to contradict the fMRI encoding data. Based on their analysis of the rostrocaudal distribution of activations reported during episodic encoding or retrieval, Lepage et al. (1998) concluded that anterior MTL is strongly associated with episodic encoding, whereas posterior MTL is strongly associated with episodic retrieval. After considering the evidence reviewed by Lepage et al. (1998) along with additional studies, we conclude that PET studies of encoding reveal both anterior and posterior MTL activations. These observations indicate that the contradiction between fMRI and PET studies of encoding was more apparent than real. However, PET studies have reported anterior MTL encoding activations more frequently than have fMRI studies. We consider possible sources of these differences.

VComplexes of yttrium and lanthanide nitrates with 4-N-(4\u2032-antipyrylmethylidene)aminoantipyrine __ Yttrium and lanthanide nitrate complexes with the Schiff base 4-N-(4\u2032-antipyrylmethylidene)aminoantipyrine (AA) of the composition of [Ln(AA)2(NO3)2]NO3 (where Ln = Y, La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho and Er) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, electrical conductance in non-aqueous solvents, magnetic susceptibility measurements, IR, electronic and proton NMR spectra and thermogravimetric analyses. The Schiff base AA acts as a tridentate ligand in all these complexes, coordinating through the oxygens of both carbonyl groups and the azomethine nitrogen. Only two of the nitrate ions are coordinated monodentately to the central metal ion, while the third remains uncoordinated.

VInhibition of autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor by a small peptide not employing an ATP\u2010competitive mechanism __ Previously we found that short peptides surrounding major autophosphorylation sites of EGFR (VPEY1068INQ, DY1148QQD, and ENAEY1173LR) suppress phosphorylation of purified EGFR to 30\u201350% at 4000 \u03bcM. In an attempt to improve potencies of the peptides, we modified the sequences by substituting various amino acids for tyrosine or by substituting Gln and Asn for Glu and Asp, respectively. Among the modified peptides, Asp/Asn\u2010 and Glu/Gln\u2010substitution in DYQQD (NYQQN) and ENAEYLR (QNAQYLR), respectively, improved inhibitory potencies. The inhibitory potency of NYQQN was not affected by the concentration of ATP, while that of QNAQYLR was affected. Docking simulations showed different mechanisms of inhibition for the peptides: inhibition by binding to the ATP\u2010binding site (QNAQYLR) and inhibition by binding to a region surrounded by \u03b1C, the activation loop, and the catalytic loop and interfering with the catalytic reaction (NYQQN). The inhibitory potency of NYQQN for insulin receptor drastically decreased, whereas QNAQYLR inhibited autophosphorylation of insulin receptor as well as EGFR. In conclusion, NYQQN is not an ATP\u2010competitive inhibitor and the binding site of this peptide appears to be novel as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. NYQQN could be a promising seed for the development of anti\u2010cancer drugs having specificity for EGFR. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 89: 40\u201351, 2008.

VAssociation Analyses Between Polymorphisms of the Phase II Detoxification Enzymes (GSTM1, NQO1, NQO2) and Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms __ Background: NRH\u2010quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) along with glutathione S\u2010transferase M1 (GSTM1) and NAD(P)H\u2010quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which is involved in phase II detoxification reactions, is thought to be important for detoxification of catechol o\u2010quinones in the central nervous system. Our previous study revealed that the human NQO2 gene is highly polymorphic. In this study, we investigated a possible association between polymorphisms of the GSTM1, NQO1, and NQO2 genes and alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as delirium tremens, hallucination, and seizure. Methods: A total of 247 Japanese male alcoholic patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms or without the symptoms, and 134 age\u2010matched Japanese male controls (nonhabitual drinkers), were examined by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism, PCR\u2010based single\u2010strand conformational change polymorphism, and PCR direct sequencing analyses. Results: A significant difference was found between alcoholic patients and controls in genotype frequency at an insertion/deletion site in the promoter region of the NQO2 gene (p= 0.0014). The frequency of the homozygous genotype for the D allele at this locus was significantly higher in delirium tremens\u2010positive patients (p= 0.0004) and in hallucination\u2010positive patients (p= 0.0001), and in patients displaying both delirium tremens and hallucination (p= 0.0002), than in controls. The values were still significant after Bonferroni correction. On the other hand, no significant difference was detected for allele frequencies or genotype frequencies for the other polymorphic loci of the NQO2 gene. Moreover, GSTM1 gene deletion and missense mutation (Pro187Ser) of the NQO1 gene showed no significant association with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: Present data suggest that an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the NQO2 gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

VDynamical computational properties of local cortical networks for visual and motor processing: A bayesian framework __ A major unsolved question concerns the interaction between the coding of information in the cortex and the collective neural operations (such as perceptual grouping, mental rotation) that can be performed on this information. A key property of the local networks in the cerebral cortex is to combine thalamocortical or feedforward information with horizontal cortico-cortical connections. Among different types of neural networks compatible with the known functional and architectural properties of the cortex, we show that there exist interesting bayesian solutions resulting in an optimal collective decision made by the neuronal population. We suggest that thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical synaptic plasticity can be differentially modulated to optimize this collective bayesian decision process. We take two examples of cortical dynamics, one for perceptual grouping in MT, and the other one for mental rotation in M1. We show that a neural implementation of the bayesian principle is both computationally efficient to perform these tasks and consistent with the experimental data on the related neuronal activities. A major implication is that a similar collective decision mechanism should exist in different cortical regions due to the similarity of the cortical functional architecture.

VInteraction of Cetyl Trimethylammonium Bromide With Poly-( N -Isopropylacrylamide- Co -Acrylic Acid) Copolymer Nanogel Particles __ Abstract: The interaction between the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide cationic surfactant and the negatively charged poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) copolymer nanogels was investigated by dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic mobility and potenciometric surfactant activity measurement. The interaction can be divided into three characteristic surfactant concentration ranges. At low surfactant concentration range the nanogel dipersion is stable, the size of the latex particles markedly decreases and the electrophoretic mobility tends to zero with the surfactant concentration. The surfactant binds to the nanogel in form of monomers. Above a certain concentration the nanogel dispersion coagulates. With a further increase of the surfactant concentration a charge reversal of the particles occurs and the nanogel dispersion becomes stable again. The size of the particles increases and the surfactant binding accelerates with increasing equilibrium surfactant concentration, i.e. the binding isotherm shows a new step reflecting collective surfactant binding. In this concentration range the features of the interaction is significantly different from the physical picture previously observed for the mixtures of poly(ethylenimine) and sodium dodecyl sulfate in which case the excess of the surfactant results in a stable colloid dispersion but the particles do not re-swell.

In the current psychiatric nomenclature, ADHD comprises three subtypes: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. In this study, we used four analytic strategies to examine the association and linkage of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and ADHD. Our sample included 122 children referred to psychiatric clinics for behavioral and learning problems that included but were not limited to ADHD, as well as their parents and siblings. Within-family analyses of linkage disequilibrium, using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), confirmed the 480-bp allele as the high-risk allele. In between-family association analyses, levels of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms but not inattentive symptoms were related to the number of DAT1 high-risk alleles. Siblings discordant for the number of DAT1 high-risk alleles differed markedly in their levels of both hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive symptoms, such that the sibling with the higher number of high-risk alleles had much higher symptom levels. Within-family analyses of linkage disequilibrium, using the TDT, suggested association and linkage of ADHD with DAT1 and that this relation was especially strong with the combined but not the inattentive subtype. The relation of DAT1 to ADHD increased monotonically, from low to medium to high levels of symptom severity. Our results replicate and extend previous findings of the association between the DAT1 gene and childhood ADHD. This represents one of the first replicated relations of a candidate gene and a psychiatric disorder in children.

VLead diffusion in apatite and zircon using ion implantation and Rutherford Backscattering techniques __ Ion implantation was used to introduce Pb into the minerals zircon and apatite. Diffusion profiles were obtained using Rutherford Backscattering, and the results were fitted with a model to determine the diffusion coefficients. This approach is both simple and useful in studying diffusion over a temperature range of geologic interest without inordinate annealing times. Results for apatite over the temperature range 600\u2013900°C are in good agreement with earlier results obtained for higher temperatures (WATSON et al., 1985) and are described by the following Arrhenius Law: D = 1.27 × 10\u22124 cm2 s\u22121 exp( \u221254.6 ± 1.7 Kcl mol\u22121 RT. This suggests that radiation damage induced by ion implantation has little effect on Pb diffusion in this case due to rapid annealing of induced damage at low temperatures. The activation energy stated above is somewhat smaller than that previously determined (70 kcal mol\u22121), reflecting the larger range in 1/T sampled by the present results. Closure temperatures calculated with these diffusion parameters are in good agreement with those inferred from geochronologic data. Diffusion coefficients for Pb in zircon determined in this study are greater than those obtained from a single experimental measurement and estimates of Pb diffusion based on geochronologic data and U/ Pb zoning in natural zircons. The differing results for zircon and apatite obtained in this study appear to be related to each mineral's ability to anneal the radiation damage induced by ion implantation.

VDevelopment of kinetic images: When does the child first represent movement in mental images? __ An experiment investigated at what age children could represent movement in imagery. Five- and eight-year olds were asked whether two stimuli were the same or different in shape. The two stimuli were either presented in the same orientation or one stimulus differed from the other by clockwise rotation of 30 ° (0.52 rad), 60 ° (1.05 rad), 120 ° (2.09 rad), or 150 ° (2.62 rad). Children were instructed to visually imagine the counterclockwise rotation of one shape into the position of the other to help make the judgment. For both 5- and 8-yr olds, reaction times increased as a linear function of angular discrepancy between stimuli, indicating that both age groups represented rotation in their imagery. The findings conflict with Piaget and Inhelder's thesis that imagery representing movement first emerges when children are 7 to 8 yrs of age.

VExploratory Analysis of Similarities in Solar Cycle Magnetic Phases with Southern Oscillation Index Fluctuations in Eastern Australia __ There is growing interest in the role that the Sun's magnetic field has on weather and climatic parameters, particularly the ~11 year sunspot (Schwab) cycle, the ~22 yr magnetic field (Hale) cycle and the ~88 yr (Gleissberg) cycle. These cycles and the derivative harmonics are part of the peculiar periodic behaviour of the solar magnetic field. Using data from 1876 to the present, the exploratory analysis suggests that when the Sun's South Pole is positive in the Hale Cycle, the likelihood of strongly positive and negative Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) values increase after certain phases in the cyclic ~22 yr solar magnetic field. The SOI is also shown to track the pairing of sunspot cycles in ~88 yr periods. This coupling of odd cycles, 23\u201315, 21\u201313 and 19\u201311, produces an apparently close charting in positive and negative SOI fluctuations for each grouping. This Gleissberg effect is also apparent for the southern hemisphere rainfall anomaly. Over the last decade, the SOI and rainfall fluctuations have been tracking similar values to that recorded in Cycle 15 (1914\u20131924). This discovery has important implications for future drought predictions in Australia and in countries in the northern and southern hemispheres which have been shown to be influenced by the sunspot cycle. Further, it provides a benchmark for long\u2010term SOI behaviour.

VDid The High Court Reach An Economic Low In Verizon v. FCC? __ The Supreme Court's decision in Verizon v. FCC rests on two errant interpretations of the 1996 Telecommunications Act: First, the Act represents a new form of regulation rather than a deregulatory statute; Second, Congress intended that the playing field be tilted in favor of new entrants. Under the Chevron Doctrine, deference is given to the controlling federal agency if there is a "rational connection" between the regulations and statutory intent. The Court ruled that the FCC's implementation of the Act survives that scrutiny. This discussion contests that finding and argues that the FCC's regulations undermine the goals of the Act.

VSpatial information transfer from virtual to real versions of the Kiel locomotor maze __ The Kiel locomotor maze requires participants to choose five targets from among 20 locations marked by small red lights on the floor of a dimly lit circular environment having four wall-mounted extramaze cues and two intramaze cues at floor level. In the present study, acquisition of the real task was examined in 11-year-old children following prior accurate training in a virtual version, following misleading virtual training, or following no training. The virtual version was displayed on a desk-top computer monitor. Acquisition testing in the real maze was either locomotor or non-locomotor. Good transfer was achieved from virtual to real versions. Children\u2019s exploration of the real maze prior to real maze acquisition training revealed a clear transfer of spatial information previously learned in the virtual version. Children taught the correct target configuration in the simulation made fewer errors and more rapid, confident responses to targets in the real maze than children given no training. However, acquisition was also better following misleading training than no training, suggesting that a non-specific components of performance also transferred. Male superiority was only seen following misleading training, which was interpreted in terms of male superiority in mental rotation. After acquisition, a single probe trial was performed, in which proximal cues and participants\u2019 starting position were rotated, but this had equivalent effects on all groups\u2019 performance. It is clear that transfer of spatial information occurs from the simulated Kiel maze to the real version. This has implications for its use in diagnosis and training.

VFeatures of atmospheric motion parameter variations at altitudes of 80\u2013105 km in two latitudinal zones of the northern hemisphere __ Observations of meteor trail drifts by means of coherent pulse radars were conducted during 326 full days in Kharkov (49°30\u2032N, 36°E) and Mogadishu (2°N, 45°E) over the period from August 1968 to July 1970. These observations have allowed the determination of basic regularities in atmospheric motion for the equatorial zone at an altitude range of 80\u2013105 km, and a comparison of the results obtained over both the equator and the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. They lead to the conclusion that there are essential differences between the circulation in the middle atmosphere of the Earth at the equatorial zone and at northern middle latitudes.

VA Proof-Theoretic Approach to Logic Programming __ We introduce a definitional extension of logic programming by means of an inference schema (Ph), which, in acertain sense, is dual to the (1-P) schema of rule application discussed in Part I. In the operational semantics, this schema is dual to the resolution principle. We prove soundness and completeness for the extended system, discuss the computation of substitutions that this new schema gives rise to, and also consider the notion of negation intrinsic to the system and its relation to negation by failure.

VObject invocation and management in the Zenith distributed multimedia information system __ Future object management systems will need to provide support for a new class of information systems: distributed multimedia design environments. Such environments pose new challenges for object management systems, requiring the integration of object-oriented techniques, distributed systems and multimedia technologies. The resulting systems must address a broad range of requirements and manage objects with a wide variety of characteristics. To meet these challenges a flexible approach to object management is required. We demonstrate how such flexibility can be achieved without incurring undue management overheads by considering the implementation of three key features of a distributed object-oriented system: persistence, object migration and access control.

VThermosensitivity of the circadian timing system __ Abstract It is well known that the circadian timing system is very sensitive to environmental light, which is not surprising given the continuous cycling of environmental light during the evolution of species and their biological clocks. Much less attention has been paid to the effect of temperature cycles on the circadian clock; these have, of course, also been present, coupled to light cycles, throughout the evolution of life. The present review addresses thermosensitivity of the neuronal substrate of the biological clock, and of the oscillations in behavior and physiology driven by the clock in ectotherms and homeotherms, which include humans. This overview of findings indicates that the biological clock is sensitive not only to local brain temperature but also, and possibly differentially, to skin temperature. Future research should be aimed at discerning the effects of these two thermal inputs on clock mechanisms. Thermosensitivity may be less pronounced than photic sensitivity. However, with a better understanding of the details of the circadian timing system thermosensitivity, it may prove feasible to apply temperature\u2010cycle entrainment in order to ameliorate sleep\u2013wake rhythm disturbances in blind, elderly and demented subjects that lack appropriate entrainment to light cycles.

VLattice calculation of the strangeness and electromagnetic nucleon form factors __ We report on recent lattice QCD calculations of the strangeness magnetic moment of the nucleon and the nucleon electromagnetic form factors, when we allow the electromagnetic current to connect to quark loops as well as to the valence quarks. Our result for the strangeness magnetic moment is GsM(0) = \u22120.36 ± 0.20. The sea contributions from the u and d quarks are about 80% larger. However, they cancel to a large extent due to their electric charges, resulting in a smaller net sea contribution of \u22120.097 ± 0.037\u03bcN to the nucleon magnetic moment. As far as the neutron to proton magnetic moment ratio is concerned, this sea contribution tends to cancel out the cloud-quark effect from the Z-graphs and result in a ratio of \u22120.68 ± 0.04 which is close to the SU(6) relation and the experiment. The strangeness Sachs electric mean-square radius \u2329r2s\u232aE is found to be small and negative and the total sea contributes substantially to the neutron electric form factor.

VEvent-Related Potentials in Homosexual and Heterosexual Men and Women: Sex-Dimorphic Patterns in Verbal Asymmetries and Mental Rotation __ To elucidate neurobiological factors related to gender and sexual orientation, event-related brain potentials of 20 heterosexual (HT) men, 20 HT women, 20 homosexual (HM) men, and 20 HM women were examined for neurophysiological differences. Cognitive tasks which typically elicit sex differences were administered. A mental rotation (MR) task assessed spatial ability, and a divided-visual-field lexical-decision/semantic monitoring task (LD/SM) assessed verbal ability and relative degrees of language lateralization. Slow wave activity recorded during MR was greater for HT men than for HT women and gay men. N400 asymmetries recorded during the LD/SM task revealed differences between men and women, but no intrasex differences.

VThe Use of the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test in Children __ Previous studies found that children are able to perform mental rotation (MR) tasks with a gender difference from the age of 4. More recently, gender differences in MR were also reported in infancy. However, different kinds of paradigms and stimuli were used. The present study investigates whether the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test (VMRT; Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978) as well as another similar 2-dimensional stimuli test may be used with elementary and middle-school children, and whether gender differences are evidenced. Results show that boys outperform girls in the middle-school group only. Elementary school children encountered difficulties solving both the VMRT and 2D MR tests. The data confirmed recent results showing that gender differences in the VMRT performance were found at age 10. We further concluded that the VMRT and 2D MR tests may not be well-designed for elementary-school children. Further investigations should focus on gender differences in MR for children younger than 9 years old as well as on the underlying causes of such difference, using other experimental paradigms.

VWorksite Health and Safety Climate: Scale Development and Effects of a Health Promotion Intervention __ Background.Environmental influences on health and health behavior have an important place in research on worksite health promotion. We tested the validity and internal consistency of a new measure of organizational health and safety climate that was used in a large randomized trial of a worksite cancer prevention program (the Working Well Trial). The resulting scales then were applied to assess intervention effects. Method.This study uses data from a subset of 40 worksites in the Working Well Trial. Employees at 20 natural gas pipeline worksites and 20 rural electrical cooperatives completed a cross-sectional questionnaire at baseline and 3-year follow-up. Results.A factor analysis of this self-report instrument produced a two-factor solution. The resulting health and safety climate scales had good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.74 and 0.82, respectively) and concurrent validity. The health climate scale was correlated more highly with organizational measures that were indicative of a supportive health climate than those indicating supportive safety climate, while the reverse was true of the safety climate scale. Changes in health climate were associated with the number of smoking and smokeless tobacco programs offered at the worksites at the time of the 3-year follow-up (r= 0.46 and 0.42, respectively). The scales were not correlated with most employee health behaviors. The health climate scores increased at intervention worksites, compared with scores at control worksites (F[1,36] = 7.57,P= 0.009). Conclusions.The health and safety climate scales developed for this study provide useful instruments for measuring organizational change related to worksite health promotion activities. The Working Well Intervention resulted in a significant improvement in worksite health climate.

VAvirulence gene avrPpiA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi is not required for full virulence on pea __ The open reading frame encoding the avirulence geneavrPpiA1, previously cloned from race 2 ofPseudomonas syringaepv.pisi, has been subcloned and shown to express peptides corresponding to all six possible start codons. The half-life of the peptides was found to be approximately 5 min inEscherichia coli. Transposon insertions which inactivate the gene inP. syringaepv.pisiwere located both within the open reading frame and in the upstream regulatory sequence, thehrp-box. Homologues of the gene were present only in races 5 and 7, which expressed the avirulence phenotype. The gene was present on the chromosome in all race 2 isolates tested, but was plasmid-borne in the type strains of races 5 and 7. In contrast to the homologueavrRpm1cloned fromP. syringaepv.maculicola, marker-exchange mutagenesis of the gene in races 2 and 7 ofP. syringaepv.pisiwas not found to affect pathogenicity towards the susceptible host as indicated by symptom development or bacterial growth in the plant.

More specifically, innovation adoption is proposed to be determined by four adopter groups technovators, supplemental experts, novices, and core experts, and the interaction between their knowledge and compatibility with the technological innovation. Compatibility occurs when a potential adopter perceives the innovation as being consistent with hisher existing values, past experiences, and needs. The model presented is intended to help researchers and practitioners successfully identify potential adopters of a technological innovation.

VBeyond sex differences in visuo\u2010spatial processing: The impact of gender trait possession __ Much research has emphasized the presence of sex differences in visuo\u2010spatial processes while neglecting individual differences in performance within the two sexes (Archer, 1987). The present study looks beyond sex differences and considers the association of self\u2010perceived gender trait possession with performance in two visuo\u2010spatial tasks. The findings indicate that, in a 3\u2010D mental rotation task, where a substantial sex difference occurred, gender trait possession adds significantly to the overall explanation of performance, the important gender trait variable being a measure of androgyny. With the Group Embedded Figures Task, gender trait measures were the only significant variables in differentiating performance, in this case masculinity was the important gender trait variable. The implication of such results for conventional explanations of individual differences in visuo\u2010spatial processing is discussed.

VInstitutional responses to bank failure: A comparative case study of the Home Bank (1923) and Canadian Commercial Bank (1985) failures __ The circumstances surrounding the collapse of the Canadian Commercial Bank in 1985 and the Home Bank in 1923 bear many resemblances. There are similarities in the economic conditions which brought about the crashes, the extent to which financial reporting helped obscure worsening conditions in the banks and the role the government played in the crashes and subsequent investigations. We identify the three parties involved, the bankers, the auditors and the legislators, and examine their reactions. We highlight the role of the auditing profession and the legislators to determine their responsibilities and how they reacted to perceived breaches. Drawing on the work of O'Connor and Offe, we outline a model of regulatory demand, interpret these events and identify implications for the reform of financial regulation in Canada.

VThe adsorption and oxidation of methanol on thin palladium films __ The adsorption of methanol (MeOH) on clean and oxygen covered Pd films, deposited on a multicrystalline Re substrate, has been studied using TPD, XPS and ISS. Significant differences in the chemistry are seen between thin (1 monolayer) and multilayer (> 10 monolayers) films, the thicker film behaving in a very similar way to the Pd {111} surface and showing a higher reactivity to MeOH decomposition, but also exhibiting higher desorption temperatures for the decomposition products when compared to the thin layer case. This behaviour is described in terms of charge transfer between the Re substrate and the Pd overlayer. The preadsorption of oxygen leads to significant structural differences in the Pd film as determined by XPS and ISS depending on the preparation temperature, and this in turn leads to significant differences in the reactivity of MeOH. When the oxygen-covered film is prepared at 300 K and exposed to MeOH, no formaldehyde is formed on desorption, whereas following a preparation temperature of 1000 K, significant amounts of formaldehyde are evolved.

VPYK2 mediates anti-apoptotic AKT signaling in response to benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide in mammary epithelial cells __ Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are known mammary carcinogens in rodents and may be involved in human breast cancer. The carcinogenicity of BaP has been partially attributed to the formation of the BaP diol epoxide (BPDE), which has been shown to stably bind DNA and act as an initiator. BaP is a complete carcinogen, but the mechanisms for tumor promotion are less well characterized. Previous studies have demonstrated that BPDE enhanced anti-apoptotic signaling through Akt; however, mechanisms for Akt activation by BPDE are not well defined. In the current studies, we found that BPDE increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. A peak in Ca2+ concentration at 20 min was followed by increased phosphorylation of Pyk2 at Tyr881 and increased total tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Consistent with activation of the EGFR, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected in MCF-10A cells treated with BPDE. Pharmacological methods to prevent Ca2+ elevation and EGFR activity, and small-interfering RNA against Pyk2, prevented Akt phosphorylation by BPDE, which suggested that Ca2+, Pyk2 and EGFR activation lay upstream of Akt. In addition, we found that BPDE increased p53 activity and apoptosis in MCF-10A; however, transient transfection of constitutively active Akt attenuated both BPDE-dependent apoptosis and p53 activity. In contrast, apoptosis was enhanced by inhibitors of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). This work demonstrates a novel mechanism for Akt activation by BPDE that occurs through increased Ca2+ concentration, and implicates Ca2+, Pyk2, EGFR and Akt as a potential pathway by which BPDE can inhibit apoptosis and act as a promoter of carcinogenesis.

VSelective impairment of hand mental rotation in patients with focal hand dystonia __ Mental rotation of body parts determines activation of cortical and subcortical systems involved in motor planning and execution, such as motor and premotor areas and basal ganglia. These structures are severely impaired in several movement disorders, including dystonia. Writer's cramp is the most common form of focal hand dystonia. This study investigates whether patients affected by writer's cramp present with difficulties in tasks involving mental rotation of body parts and whether any impairments are specific to the affected hand or generalized to other body parts. For this purpose we tested 15 patients with right writer's cramp (aged 21\u201368 years, 8 women) and 15 healthy control subjects (10 women, age and education matched). Stimuli consisted of realistic photographs of hands and feet presented on a computer monitor in different orientations with respect to the upright canonical orientation. In each trial, subjects gave a laterality judgement by reporting verbally whether the presented body part was left or right. Two main results of the study are, firstly, writer's cramp patients are slower than controls in mentally rotating hands [F (1,28) = 5.4; P = 0.028] but not feet, and secondly, the pattern of response times to stimuli at various orientations suggests that the mental motor imagery of controls and patients reflects the type of processes and mechanisms called into play during actual execution of the same movements. In particular, increased difficulty in rotating right-sided stimuli at 120° and left-sided stimuli at 240° would suggest that mental rotation of body parts reflects the anatomical constraints of real hand movements. In conclusion, patients with writer's cramp presented mental rotation deficits specific to the hand. Importantly, deficits were present during mental rotation of both the right (affected) and the left (unaffected) hand, thus suggesting that the observed alterations may be independent and even exist prior to overt manifestations of dystonia.

VEffect of visual\u2013spatial ability on medical students' performance in a gross anatomy course __ The ability to mentally manipulate objects in three dimensions is essential to the practice of many clinical medical specialties. The relationship between this type of visual\u2013spatial ability and performance in preclinical courses such as medical gross anatomy is poorly understood. This study determined if visual\u2013spatial ability is associated with performance on practical examinations, and if students' visual\u2013spatial ability improves during medical gross anatomy. Three hundred and fifty\u2010two first\u2010year medical students completed the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) before the gross anatomy course and 255 at its completion in 2008 and 2009. Hypotheses were tested using logistic regression analysis and Student's t\u2010test. Compared with students in the lowest quartile of the MRT, students who scored in the highest quartile of the MRT were 2.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2 and 3.8] and 2.1 (95% CI 1.2 and 3.5) times more likely to score greater than 90% on practical examinations and on both practical and written examinations, respectively. MRT scores for males and females increased significantly (P < 0.0001). Measurement of students' pre\u2010existing visual\u2013spatial ability is predictive of performance in medical gross anatomy, and early intervention may be useful for students with low visual\u2013spatial ability on entry to medical school. Participation in medical gross anatomy increases students' visual\u2013spatial ability, although the mechanism for this phenomenon is unknown.

VEvaluation of Wheat Gluten in Milk Replacers and Calf Starters __ Two trials were conducted to evaluate wheat gluten as an ingredient in calf feeds. In one trial, Holstein bull calves (n = 120) were assigned for 6 wk to one of five milk replacers, which contained different percentages of CP and different percentages of protein furnished from soluble wheat gluten. Within a given protein percentage, BW gains of calves were not affected by the percentage of protein that was supplied as wheat gluten. Calves fed milk replacer containing 18% CP with 33% wheat gluten gained as much as calves fed replacers containing 20% CP.In another trial, newborn Holstein calves (n = 62) were used. Protein supplements of the calf starters used until 7 wk of age were either soybean meal or spray-dried wheat gluten and soybean meal. No significant differences were observed between the two treatments. Also, no significant carry-over effect occurred when all calves received a common diet from 7 to 10 wk of age.

VA PACE Sensor System with Machine Learning-Based Energy Expenditure Regression Algorithm __ Abstract: This paper presents a portable-accelerometer and electrocardiogram (PACE) sensor system and a machine learning-based energy expenditure regression algorithm. The PACE sensor system includes motion sensors and an electrocardiogram sensor, a MCU module (microcontroller), a wireless communication module (a RF transceiver and a Bluetooth® module), and a storage module (flash memory). A machine learning-based energy expenditure regression algorithm consisting of the procedures of data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, and construction of energy expenditure regression model has been developed in this study. The sequential forward search and the sequential backward search were employed as the feature selection strategies, and a generalized regression neural network were employed as the energy expenditure regression models in this study. Our experimental results exhibited that the proposed machine learning-based energy expenditure regression algorithm can achieve satisfactory energy expenditure estimation by combing appropriate feature selection technique with machine learning-based regression models.

We find a unique negative mode when the black hole has a negative heat capacity which is the same in Einstein theory. On the other hand, we still find negative modes inside a parameter region where a small black hole has a positive heat capacity. The number is one/two for the case of zero/negative cosmological constant, respectively. In the rest of the parameter region where the heat capacity is positive, we find no negative modes. We discuss the possible physical understanding of having one or two negative modes.

VFour\u2010year clinical follow\u2010up of the XIENCE V everolimus\u2010eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of patients with de novo coronary artery lesions: The SPIRIT II trial __ This report describes the 4\u2010year clinical outcomes of the SPIRIT II study, which randomized 300 patients to treatment with the XIENCE V everolimus\u2010eluting stent (EES), or the TAXUS paclitaxel\u2010eluting stent. At 4\u2010year clinical follow\u2010up, which was available in 256 (85.3%) patients, treatment with EES lead to a trend for lower rates of ischemia\u2010driven major adverse cardiovascular events, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemia\u2010driven target lesion revascularization (EES 7.7% vs. paclitaxel\u2010eluting stent 16.4%, P = 0.056). Treatment with EES also resulted in a trend toward lower rates of cardiac death and numerically lower rates of myocardial infarction, ischemia\u2010driven target lesion revascularization, and stent thrombosis. Overall, this study reports numerically fewer clinical events in patients treated with EES at 4\u2010year follow\u2010up, which is consistent with results from earlier follow\u2010up. © 2010 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VNeurophysiological evaluation of trigeminal and facial nerves in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy __ Cranial neuropathy is clinically uncommon in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), but there is little information on the neurophysiological examination of cranial nerve involvement. To determine the incidence of trigeminal and facial nerve involvement in patients with CIDP, the direct response of the orbicularis oculi muscle to percutaneous electric stimulation of the facial nerve and the blink reflex (induced by stimulation of the supraorbital nerve) were examined in 20 CIDP patients. The latency of the direct response was increased in 12 patients (60%) and an abnormal blink reflex was observed in 17 patients (85%). There was no correlation between electrophysiological findings and the latencies of the direct and R1 responses and disease duration or clinical grade in CIDP patients. Nevertheless, the prevalence of subclinical trigeminal and facial neuropathy is extremely high in patients with CIDP when examined by neurophysiological tests. Muscle Nerve 2006

VRepresentation of anatomical constraints in motor imagery: Mental rotation of a body segment __ Classically, the mental rotation paradigm has shown that when subjects are asked to judge whether objects that differ in orientation are spatially congruent, reaction times increase with angular discrepancy, although some reports have shown that this is not always the case. Would similar results be obtained with realistic figures of body segments? In this work, the mental rotation of a hand attached to its forearm and arm in anatomically possible and impossible starting positions is compared with the mental rotation of a hammer. The main results show that reaction times increase monotonically with the angle of discrepancy for both stimuli and that the speed of rotation is higher for anatomically possible orientations in the case of the hand. Thus, mental rotation of body segments follows the same empirical rules as objects of another nature, and biomechanical constraints imposed to the motility of these segments can be considered as attributes of the mental representation.

VUsing Manual Rotation and Gesture to Improve Mental Rotation in Preschoolers __ We report the effects on accuracy and reaction time at a mental rotation task for four year old subjects who were either given practice rotating objects on a computer screen by turning a joystick or gesturing about rotating objects on a computer screen. We found that training children to gesture about rotation improves performance on MR. Children who were given practice rotating objects with a joystick do not show the same level of RT improvement as children who either gestured about movement or who simply practiced the task over the course of the experiment without any training.

VTwo routes to expertise in mental rotation. __ The ability to imagine objects undergoing rotation (mental rotation) improves markedly with practice but an explanation of this plasticity remains controversial. Some researchers propose that practice speeds up the rate of a general-purpose rotation algorithm. Others maintain that performance improvements arise through the adoption of a new cognitive strategy \u2014 repeated exposure leads to rapid retrieval from memory of the required response to familiar mental-rotation stimuli. In two experiments we provide support for an integrated explanation of practice effects in mental rotation by combining behavioural and EEG measures in a way that provides more rigorous inference than is available from either measure alone. Before practice participants displayed two well-established signatures of mental rotation: both response time and EEG negativity increased linearly with rotation angle. After extensive practice with a small set of stimuli, both signatures of mental rotation had all but disappeared. In contrast, after the same amount of practice with a much larger set both signatures remained, even though performance improved markedly. Taken together these results constitute a reversed association, which cannot arise from variation in a single cause, and so they provide compelling evidence for the existence of two routes to expertise in mental rotation. We also found novel evidence that practice with the large but not the small stimulus set increased the magnitude of an early visual evoked potential, suggesting increased rotation speed is enabled by improved efficiency in extracting three-dimensional information from two-dimensional stimuli.

VEffects of Power on Mental Rotation and Emotion Recognition in Women __ Based on construal-level theory (CLT) and its view of power as an instance of social distance, we predicted that high, relative to low power would enhance women\u2019s mental-rotation performance and impede their emotion-recognition performance. The predicted effects of power emerged both when it was manipulated via a recall priming task (Study 1) and environmental cues (Studies 2 and 3). Studies 3 and 4 found evidence for mediation by construal level of the effect of power on emotion recognition but not on mental rotation. We discuss potential mediating mechanisms for these effects based on both the social distance/construal level and the approach/inhibition views of power. We also discuss implications for optimizing performance on mental rotation and emotion recognition in everyday life.

VSalivary testosterone does not predict mental rotation performance in men or women __ Multiple studies report relationships between circulating androgens and performance on sexually differentiated spatial cognitive tasks in human adults, yet other studies find no such relationships. Relatively small sample sizes are a likely source of some of these discrepancies. The present study thus tests for activational effects of testosterone (T) using a within-participants design by examining relationships between diurnal fluctuations in salivary T and performance on a male-biased spatial cognitive task (Mental Rotation Task) in the largest sample yet collected: 160 women and 177 men. T concentrations were unrelated to within-sex variation in mental rotation performance in both sexes. Further, between-session learning-related changes in performance were unrelated to T levels, and circadian changes in T were unrelated to changes in spatial performance in either sex. These results suggest that circulating T does not contribute substantially to sex differences in spatial ability in young men and women. By elimination, the contribution of androgens to sex differences in human performance on these tasks may be limited to earlier, organizational periods.

VA Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Young Infants __ Three- to 4-month-old female and male human infants were administered a two-dimensional mental-rotation task similar to those given to older children and adults. Infants were familiarized with the number 1 (or its mirror image) in seven different rotations between 01 and 3601, and then preference-tested with a novel rotation of the familiar stimulus paired with its mirror image. Male infants displayed a novelty preference for the mirror-image stimulus over the novel rotation of the familiar stimulus, whereas females divided attention between the two test stimuli. The results point toward an early emergence of a sex difference in mental rotation.

VSEX DIFFERENCES IN MENTAL ROTATION STRATEGY __ When humans decide whether two visual stimuli are identical or mirror images of each other and one of the stimuli is rotated with respect to the other, the time discrimination takes usually increases as a rectilinear function of the orientation disparity. On the average, males perform this mental rotation at a faster angular speed than females. This experiment required the rotation of both mirror-image-different and non-mirror-different stimuli. The polygonal stimuli were presented in either spatially unfiltered, high-pass or low-pass filtered versions. All stimulus conditions produced mental rotation-type effects but with graded curvilinear trends. Women rotated faster than men under all conditions, an infrequent outcome in mental rotation studies. Overall, women yielded more convexly curvilinear response functions than men. For both sexes the curvilinearity was more pronounced under the non-mirror-different, low-pass stimulus condition than under the mirror different, high-pass stimulus condition. The results are considered as supporting the occurrence of two different mental rotation strategies and as suggesting that the women were predisposed to use efficiently an analytic feature rotation strategy, while the men were predisposed to employ efficiently a holistic pattern rotation strategy. It is argued that the overall design of this experiment promoted the application of an analytic strategy and thus conferred an advantage to the female participants.

VSpatial anxiety relates to spatial abilities as a function of working memory in children __ Spatial ability is a strong predictor of students\u2019 pursuit of higher education in science and mathematics. However, very little is known about the affective factors that influence individual differences in spatial ability, particularly at a young age. We examine the role of spatial anxiety in young children\u2019s performance on a mental rotation task. We show that even at a young age, children report experiencing feelings of nervousness at the prospect of engaging in spatial activities. Moreover, we show that these feelings are associated with reduced mental rotation ability among students with high but not low working memory (WM). Interestingly, this WM × spatial anxiety interaction was only found among girls. We discuss these patterns of results in terms of the problem-solving strategies that boys versus girls use in solving mental rotation problems.

VThe Comparison of Mental Rotation Performance in Team and Individual Sports of Students __ As a practical and causal-comparative study, the present study was aimed at comparing the mental rotation performance in team and individual sports among students. The statistical population included all of the female and male athletes (N=1500) from different districts of Shiraz, Iran who participated in the sport clubs. The participants of this study included 240 students between 12-14 years old (120 girls and 120 boys) who were selected randomly from four sport fields (Volleyball, Basketball, Karate, and Gymnastics). Finally, 30 athletes were selected from each field. The Mentrat Program, a kind of software for the Mental Rotation Test was used as an evaluation tool. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures were conducted to analysis of data. The results indicated that the impact of the rotational angle was significant in both team and individual groups (p<0.05) while there was not any significant difference in the mental rotation performance in the team and individual sports of the male and female participants (p>0.05). It was also observed that there was a significant difference between the mental rotation scores of the males in the individual groups contrary to the ones in the team groups (p<0.05). As a whole, it seems that as the rotational angle increases, the ability of the mental rotation in the individual fields of sport (males) will be higher compared to the team groups.

VSpatial Transformations of Bodies and Objects in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder __ Previous research into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has shown people with autism to be impaired at visual perspective taking. However it is still unclear to what extent the spatial mechanisms underlying this ability contribute to these difficulties. In the current experiment we examine spatial transformations in adults with ASD and typical adults. Participants performed egocentric transformations and mental rotation of bodies and cars. Results indicated that participants with ASD had general perceptual differences impacting on response times across tasks. However, they also showed more specific differences in the egocentric task suggesting particular difficulty with using the self as a reference frame. These findings suggest that impaired perspective taking could be grounded in difficulty with the spatial transformation used to imagine the self in someone else\u2019s place.

VWhat does the Mental Rotation Test Measure? An Analysis of Item Difficulty and Item Characteristics __ The present study examined the contributions of various item characteristics to the difficulty of the individual items on the Mental Rotation Test (MRT). Analyses of item difficulties from a large data set of university students were conducted to assess the role of time limitation, distractor type, occlusion, configuration type, and the degree of angular disparity. Results replicated in large part previous findings that indicated that occluded items were significantly more difficult than non-occluded and that mirror items were more difficult than structural items. An item characteristic not previously examined in the literature, configuration type (homogeneous versus heterogeneous), also was found to be associated with item difficulty. Interestingly, no significant association was found between angular disparity and difficulty. Multiple regression analysis revealed that a model consisting of occlusion and configuration type alone was sufficient for explaining 53 percent of the variance in item difficulty. No interaction between these two factors was found. It is suggested, based on overall results, that basic figure perception, identification and comparison, but not necessarily mental rotation, account for much of the variance in item difficulty on the MRT.

VMeasure of the ability to rotate mental images __ The aim of this study was to design an innovative test to measure the ability to rotate mental images. An unfolded cube was designed, which participants had to reassemble mentally, prior to mentally rotating the image, and answering 23 questions concerning the cube. The Measure of the Ability to Rotate Mental Images (MARMI) test was administered to 354 participants. Cronbach alpha was .90, and high correlations between this test and other image rotation and spatial image tests were found. However, poor correlations were observed between test scores and the responses to the visual imagery vividness questionnaire. Both test reliability and validity underscore that it is a good instrument for measuring the ability to rotate mental images.

VA novel method for incorporation of ion channels into a planar phospholipid bilayer which allows solution changes on a millisecond timescale __ Abstract: We have developed a method of rapidly changing the solutions on one side of a planar phospholipid bilayer. Bilayers can be painted on glass pipettes of tip diameter \u2a7e 50 \u03bcm. By modifying an established method for rapid exchange of solutions bathing excised membrane patches, solution changes can be made at the bilayer within 10 ms. After incorporation of channels into the bilayer, the bilayer is moved into one of two parallel streams of solution flowing from a length of double-barrelled glass theta tubing. Activation of a solenoid system rapidly moves the theta tubing so that the bilayer is in the flow of the adjacent solution. For various reasons, the single-channel gating mechanisms of many channels are studied in planar bilayer systems. The conventional bilayer technique only allows for steady-state single-channel gating to be monitored. This novel method now allows the effects of rapid changes in modulators of channels incorporated into planar phospholipid bilayers to be measured.

VIdentification of the pro-mature processing site of Toxoplasma ROP1 by mass spectrometry __ The rhoptries are specialized secretory organelles that function during host cell invasion in the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. All T. gondii rhoptry proteins studied to date are synthesized as pro-proteins that are then processed to their mature forms. To understand the role of the pro region in rhoptry protein function, we have precisely defined the processing site of the pro region of the rhoptry protein ROP1. Efforts to determine such processing sites have been prevented by blocked N-termini of mature proteins isolated from T. gondii. To overcome this problem, we have used an engineered form of ROP1 and mass spectrometry to demonstrate that proROP1 is processed to its mature form between the glutamic acid at position 83 and alanine at position 84. These data also show that mature ROP1 lacks substantial post-translational modifications, a result which has important implications for targeting of rhoptry proteins.

VEffects of the circumference of codends and a new design of square-mesh panel in reducing unwanted by-catch in the New South Wales oceanic prawn-trawl fishery, Australia __ Effects on the escape of small fish from prawn-trawl codends due to (i) codend circumference and (ii) a new design of square-mesh panel were investigated in the New South Wales oceanic prawn-trawl fishery. Simultaneous comparisons of two conventional diamond-mesh codends, constructed with posterior sections of 100 and 200 meshes circumference, respectively, showed that halving this circumference significantly altered the selectivity of the codend and decreased the by-catch of small fish. A new design of square-mesh panel incorporated composite panels of netting (60 mm and 40 mm mesh), sewn in such a way that the meshes were square-shaped and inserted into the top of the anterior section of the codend. This panel was designed to aliow larger fish to escape through the 60 mm mesh (at the point where waterflow was thought to be the greatest) and also increase the random escape of smaller individuals through the 40 mm mesh. To determine any influences of codend circumference on the performance of this panel, it was inserted into two codends with posterior sections of 100 and 200 meshes circumference, respectively. Simultaneous comparisons with each other and with their controls showed that the two-panelled codends, with posterior sections of both 100 and 200 meshes, performed similarly and significantly reduced the weights of discarded by-catch without significantly reducing the catch of prawns. There was evidence that more fish tended to escape through the square-mesh panel in the codend with the posterior section of 200 meshes circumference. The results are discussed in terms of the effects that codend circumference (and therefore hydrodynamic pressure) may have on the escape of small fish through codends that do/do not have square-mesh panels.

VEffects of Using Mental and Manual Rotation Training on Mental and Manual Rotation Performance __ The goal of this project was to examine how training either mental or manual (virtual) rotation, affects performance gains on either a mental or a manual rotation task. In Experiment 1, we examined improvement on a manual rotation ask following practice in mental rotation, manual rotation and a control condition. Practice in mental but not manual rotation lead to improved performance on manual rotation, compared to the control condition. In Experiment 2, we examined improvement on a mental rotation task as a function of the same 3 training conditions. In this experiment, both mental and manual rotation practice lead to more efficient posttest performance relative to the control condition. These results suggest common processes in mental and manual rotation, related to mental planning.

VContributions of Spatial Working Memory to Visuomotor Learning __ Previous studies of motor learning have described the importance of cognitive processes during the early stages of learning; however, the precise nature of these processes and their neural correlates remains unclear. The present study investigated whether spatial working memory (SWM) contributes to visuomotor adaptation depending on the stage of learning. We tested the hypothesis that SWM would contribute early in the adaptation process by measuring (i) the correlation between SWM tasks and the rate of adaptation, and (ii) the overlap between the neural substrates of a SWM mental rotation task and visuomotor adaptation. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, a visuomotor adaptation task, and an SWM task involving mental rotation, with the latter two tasks performed in a 3.0-T MRI scanner. Performance on a neuropsychological test of SWM (two-dimensional mental rotation) correlated with the rate of early, but not late, visuomotor adaptation. During the early, but not late, adaptation period, participants showed overlapping brain activation with the SWM mental rotation task, in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral inferior parietal lobules. These findings suggest that the early, but not late, phase of visuomotor adaptation engages SWM processes.

VNeurobiological Correlates of Social Conformity and Independence During Mental Rotation __ Background: When individual judgment conflicts with a group, the individual will often conform his judgment to that of the group. Conformity might arise at an executive level of decision making, or it might arise because the social setting alters the individual\u2019s perception of the world. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task of mental rotation in the context of peer pressure to investigate the neural basis of individualistic and conforming behavior in the face of wrong information. Results: Conformity was associated with functional changes in an occipital-parietal network, especially when the wrong information originated from other people. Independence was associated with increased amygdala and caudate activity, findings consistent with the assumptions of social norm theory about the behavioral saliency of standing alone. Conclusions: These findings provide the first biological evidence for the involvement of perceptual and emotional processes during social conformity.

VObject\u2013spatial imagery and verbal cognitive styles in children and adolescents: Developmental trajectories in relation to ability __ A new self-report instrument, the Children's Object\u2013Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (C-OSIVQ), was designed to assess cognitive styles in younger populations (8\u201317 years old). The questionnaire was based on the previously developed adult version of the Object\u2013Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ; Blazhenkova & Kozhevnikov, 2009), and includes three scales assessing object, spatial, and verbal cognitive styles. The C-OSIVQ was validated on a large sample consisting of 267 children and 83 college students. It demonstrated high internal reliability, predictive, and ecological validity in both children and adults. Following the design and validation of the C-OSIVQ, the development of object, spatial, and verbal cognitive styles and their corresponding abilities was examined across a wide range of ages (8\u201360 years old). The development of styles and abilities were strongly correlated across age groups, indicating that the trajectory of cognitive style development closely resembles the developmental trajectory of abilities; however, the development of cognitive style is more gradual and smooth.

VDifferent strategies do not moderate primary motor cortex involvement in mental rotation: a TMS study __ Background: Regions of the dorsal visual stream are known to play an essential role during the process of mental rotation. The functional role of the primary motor cortex (M1) in mental rotation is however less clear. It has been suggested that the strategy used to mentally rotate objects determines M1 involvement. Based on the strategy hypothesis that distinguishes between an internal and an external strategy, our study was designed to specifically test the relation between strategy and M1 activity. Methods: Twenty-two subjects were asked to participate in a standard mental rotation task. We used specific picture stimuli that were supposed to trigger either the internal (e.g. pictures of hands or tools) or the external strategy (e.g. pictures of houses or abstract figures). The strategy hypothesis predicts an involvement of M1 only in case of stimuli triggering the internal strategy (imagine grasping and rotating the object by oneself). Single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was employed to quantify M1 activity during task performance by measuring Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) at the right hand muscle. Results: Contrary to the strategy hypothesis, we found no interaction between stimulus category and corticospinal excitability. Instead, corticospinal excitability was generally increased compared with a resting baseline although subjects indicated more frequent use of the external strategy for all object categories. Conclusion: This finding suggests that M1 involvement is not exclusively linked with the use of the internal strategy but rather directly with the process of mental rotation. Alternatively, our results might support the hypothesis that M1 is active due to a 'spill-over' effect from adjacent brain regions.

VMental rotation is not easily cognitively penetrable __ When participants take part in mental imagery experiments, are they using their \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d of perception to mimic what they believe should occur in the corresponding perceptual task? Two experiments were conducted to examine whether such an account can be applied to mental imagery in general. These experiments both examined tasks that required participants to \u201cmentally rotate\u201d stimuli. In Experiment 1, instructions led participants to believe that they could reorient shapes in one step or avoid reorienting the shapes altogether. Regardless of instruction type, response times increased linearly with increasing rotation angles. In Experiment 2, participants first observed novel objects rotating at different speeds, and then performed a mental rotation task with those objects. The speed of perceptually demonstrated rotation did not affect the speed of mental rotation. We argue that tacit knowledge cannot explain mental imagery results in general, and that in particular the mental rotation effect reflects the nature of the underlying internal representation and processes that transform it, rather than participants\u2019 pre-existing knowledge.

VSex differences in mental rotation: Top\u2013down versus bottom\u2013up processing __ Functional MRI during performance of a validated mental rotation task was used to assess a neurobiological basis for sex differences in visuospatial processing. Between-sex group analysis demonstrated greater activity in women than in men in dorsalmedial prefrontal and other high-order heteromodal association cortices, suggesting women performed mental rotation in an effortful, \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d fashion. In contrast, men activated primary sensory cortices as well as regions involved in implicit learning (basal ganglia) and mental imagery (precuneus), consistent with a more automatic, \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d strategy. Functional connectivity analysis in association with a measure of behavioral performance showed that, in men (but not women), accurate performance was associated with deactivation of parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) as part of a visual\u2013vestibular network. Automatic evocation by men to a greater extent than women of this network during mental rotation may represent an effective, unconscious, bottom\u2013up neural strategy which could reasonably account for men's traditional visuospatial performance advantage.

VControlled and automatic processing during mental rotation __ In two experiments, 9- and 10-year-olds and adults were tested on a mental rotation task in which they judged whether stimuli presented in different orientations were letters or mirror-images of letters. The mental rotation task was performed alone on 48 trials and concurrently with a memory task on 48 additional trials. The concurrent memory task in Experiment 1 was recalling digits; in Experiment 2, recalling positions in a matrix. The key result was that the slope of the function relating response time to stimulus orientation was the same when the mental rotation task was performed alone and when performed concurrently with the memory task. This result is interpreted as showing that mental rotation is an automatic process for both children and adults.

VSearch for Higgs bosons and other massive states decaying into two photons in e+e\u2212 collisions at 189 GeV __ A search is described for the generic process e+e\u2212\u2192XY, where X is a neutral heavy scalar boson decaying into a pair of photons, and Y is a neutral heavy boson (scalar or vector) decaying into a fermion pair. The search is motivated mainly by the cases where either X, or both X and Y, are Higgs bosons. In particular, we investigate the case where X is the Standard Model Higgs boson and Y the Z0 boson. Other models with enhanced Higgs boson decay couplings to photon pairs are also considered. The present search combines the data set collected by the OPAL collaboration at 189 GeV collider energy, having an integrated luminosity of 182.6 pb\u22121, with data samples collected at lower energies. The search results have been used to put 95% confidence level bounds, as functions of the mass MX, on the product of the cross-section and the relevant branching ratios, both in a model independent manner and for the particular models considered.

VCortical activity during rotational and linear transformations __ Neuroimaging studies of cortical activation during image transformation tasks have shown that mental rotation may rely on similar brain regions as those underlying visual perceptual mechanisms. The V5 complex, which is specialised for visual motion, is one region that has been implicated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate rotational and linear transformation of stimuli. Areas of significant brain activation were identified for each of the primary mental transformation tasks in contrast to its own perceptual reference task which was cognitively matched in all respects except for the variable of interest. Analysis of group data for perception of rotational and linear motion showed activation in areas corresponding to V5 as defined in earlier studies. Both rotational and linear mental transformations activated Brodman Area (BA) 19 but did not activate V5. An area within the inferior temporal gyrus, representing an inferior satellite area of V5, was activated by both the rotational perception and rotational transformation tasks, but showed no activation in response to linear motion perception or transformation. The findings demonstrate the extent to which neural substrates for image transformation and perception overlap and are distinct as well as revealing functional specialisation within perception and transformation processing systems.

VLoss of bone mineral of the hip assessed by DEXA following tibial shaft fractures __ We measured prospectively early changes (0\u20136 months) in bone mineral of the hip, the lumbar spine, and the tibia following tibial shaft fractures (n = 12), and in a cross-sectional study we evaluated the maximal amount of bone loss possible at the hip and tibia following long-term (average 3 years) impaired limb function as a consequence of complicated tibial shaft fractures [delayed union or nonunion (n = 7), chronic osteomyelitis (n = 5), decreased limb length (n = 1), or bone defect (n = 1)]. Bone mineral measurements were performed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Following tibial shaft fractures, a significant decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) was seen at the hip reaching 7% [confidence limits (CL): \u221210.2%; \u22123.5%] and 14% (CL: \u221219.6; \u22127.8%) after 6 months for the femoral neck and greater trochanter, respectively. In the proximal tibia, bone mineral content (BMC) decreased and was 19% (CL: \u221227.4%; \u22129.9%) below the initial value after 6 months. BMD of the lumbar spine remained unchanged. In the cross-sectional study, BMC in the tibia of the injured legs was 43% (CL: \u221253.2%; \u221231.9%) below the value in the healthy contralateral legs, and BMD in the femoral neck and greater trochanter, respectively, was 22% (CL: \u221227.4%; \u221217.6%) and 24% (CL: \u221236.3%; \u221212.1%) below the values in the healthy contralateral legs. With respect to the expected age-related decay of bone mineral after peak bone mass, the loss of bone mineral of the hip and tibia associated with tibial shaft fractures may be considered of clinical importance with increased risk of sustaining a fragility fracture of the lower extremity later in life; and the complicated fractures may even represent a present risk of fracture.

VSex Differences in Right Hemisphere Tasks __ We tested the hypothesis that sex differences in spatial ability and emotional perception are due to sex differences in intrahemispheric organization of the right hemisphere. If the right hemisphere is differently organized by sex\u2014primarily specialized for spatial ability in men, but primarily specialized for emotional perception in women\u2014then there should be a negative correlation between spatial ability and emotional perception within sex, and the greatest disparity between abilities should be found in people with characteristic arousal of the right hemisphere. Undergraduate men (N= 86) and women (N= 132) completed tests of Mental Rotation, Surface Development, Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity, Progressive Matrices, and Chimeric Faces. Although the expected pattern of sex differences was observed, there was no evidence for the hypothesized negative correlation between spatial ability and emotional perception, even after statistical control of general intelligence.

VOn the relationship between group functioning and study success in problem\u2010based learning __ Introduction\u2002 In problem\u2010based learning (PBL), discussion in the tutorial group plays a central role in stimulating student learning. Problems are the principal input for stimulating discussion. The quality of discussion is assumed to influence student learning and, in the end, study success. Aims\u2002 To investigate the relationships between aspects of group functioning and study success. Methods\u2002 First\u2010year medical students (n\u2003=\u2003116), forming 12 PBL groups, completed a 21\u2010item questionnaire on various aspects of a PBL session. At the end of the unit, a course examination was administered. Scales were constructed and reliability analyses conducted. Results\u2002 Group functioning and case quality were strongly correlated with students' grades in a course examination. Further, students' perceptions of group functioning, case quality and the quality of their own contribution were linked strongly with each other. Conclusions\u2002 Group functioning, case quality and study success are associated with each other in PBL. The interaction between these aspects of PBL in promoting learning calls for further investigation.

VESTIMATION OF OUTPUT ERROR MODELS IN THE PRESENCE OF UNKNOWN BUT BOUNDED DISTURBANCES __ In the context of set membership identification the feasible parameter set is defined as the set of plant parameters which are consistent with the model structure, the assumptions on (unknown but bounded) disturbances and all available measurements. It appears more convenient in practice to build an outer\u2010bounding set, typically an ellipsoid, a parallelotope or an orthotope. This paper describes methods for adjusting set membership techniques, which are only applicable to equation error models, to the case of output error models. A method for building the optimal outer\u2010bounding orthotope is also proposed. Equation error and output error methods are evaluated on the example of the estimation of a missile state space model in the presence of measurement noise and neglected dynamics. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VConstruction of the JAERI tandem booster __ The JAERI tandem booster is under construction. The booster linac consists of 40 superconducting quarter wave resonators made of niobium and niobium-clad copper. We carried out off-line tests of 16 resonators and obtained electric field levels of about 6.5 MV/m at an rf input of 4 W. Maximum field levels of some resonators exceeded 10 MV/m. We found that Q-degradation occurred when resonators were cooled slowly at a temperature of about 120 K.

VEffects of Blood Estrogen Level on Cortical Activation Patterns during Cognitive Activation as Measured by Functional MRI __ Modulation of the blood estrogen level as it occurs during the menstrual cycle has a strong influence on both neuropsychological and neurophysiological parameters. One of currently preferred hypotheses is that the menstrual cycle hormones modulate functional hemispheric lateralization. We examined six male and six female subjects by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to image cortical activation patterns associated with cognitive and motor activation to determine whether these changes during the menstrual cycle can be visualized. Female subjects, who did not use oral contraceptives, were scanned twice, once during the menses and once on the 11/12 day of the menstrual cycle. A word-stem-completion task, a mental rotation task and a simple motor task were performed by all subjects. Our data provide evidence that the menstrual cycle hormones influence the overall level of cerebral hemodynamics to a much stronger degree than they influence the activation pattern itself. No differences were seen between male subjects and female subjects during the low estrogen phase. During both neuropsychological tasks blood estrogenlevel had a profound effect on the size but not on the lateralization or the localization of cortical activation patterns. The female brain under estrogen showed a marked increase in perfusion in cortical areasinvolved in both cognitive tasks, whereas the hemodynamic effects during the motor tasks were less pronounced. This might be due to differences in neuronal or endothelian receptor concentration, differences in synaptic function, or, most likely, changes in the cerebrovascular anatomy in different cortical regions.

VPostoperative analgesia in children: A prospective study of intermittent intramuscular injection versus continuous intravenous infusion of morphine __ Few advancements in postoperative pain control in children have been made despite longstanding inadequacies in conventional intramuscular analgesic regimens. While overestimating narcotic complication rates, physicians often underestimate efficacious doses, nurses are reluctant to give injections, and many children in pain shy away from shots. This study prospectively focuses on the safety, efficacy, and complication rate of intermittent intramuscular (IM) versus continuous intravenous infusion (IV) of morphine sulfate (MS) in 46 nonventilated children following major chest, abdominal, or orthopedic surgical procedures. Twenty patients assigned to the IM group had a mean age of 6.17 years and a mean weight of 23.0 kg. Twenty-six patients assigned to the IV group had a mean age of 8.74 years and a mean weight of 27.4 kg. The mean IM MS dose was 12.3 \u03bcg/kg/h while the mean IV dose was 19.8 \u03bcg/kg/h (P < .001). Postoperative pain was assessed with a linear analogue scale from 1 to 10 (1, \u201cdoesn't hurt\u201d; 10, \u201cworst hurt possible\u201d) for 3 days following operation. Using the analysis of covariance (ANACOVA), nurse, parent, and patient mean pain scores in the IV group were significantly lower than those of the IM group when controlled for age, MS dose, and complications (P < .007). Nurse assessment of pain correlated well with the patient and parent assessments (Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.6). Not only did IV infusion give better pain relief than IM injections, but there were no major complications such as respiratory depression. Minor complications in this study (nausea, urinary retention, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations, lightheadedness, and prolonged ileus) were not significantly different between IM and IV groups. Continuous IV morphine infusion is a safe and more effective means of postoperative pain control in children.

VPreserved cognitive processes in cerebellar degeneration __ Aspects of cognitive processing in patients with cerebellar degeneration (CD) were studied in order to examine the validity of recent findings that CD patients demonstrate deficits in visuospatial cognition and verbal-associative learning. Two groups of patients with CD were compared to stratified matched control groups on tests examining selective visual attention, visual spatial attention, mental rotation of geometric designs, and memory for the temporal order of words they were previously exposed to. CD patients performed similarly to their matched controls across all tasks. These results indicate that the reported cognitive deficits of CD patients are quite selective and need further specification in order to more fully describe their relationship to cerebellar dysfunction.

On the basis of the experimental results, the structure of the gels in various solvents was estimated. PVA gels have a uniform structure with flexible PVA chains in a mixed solvent of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and water. On the other hand, those swollen in methanol, ethanol and formamide have a two-phase structure, which is composed of PVA-rich and solvent-rich phases. The PVA chains in the PVA-rich phase are crosslinked by hydrogen bonding.

VGender differences in brain activation patterns during mental rotation and number related cognitive tasks __ Gender differences in the visuo-spatial and mathematical cognitive domain seem to rely on the preferences for different cognitive strategies. Such differences may involve or reflect different neural circuits. In this study three number related tasks and a mental rotation fMRI-paradigm were used to examine whether different brain activation and performance patterns could be observed between genders. In a simple magnitude comparison task no gender differences in brain activation patterns were found. In contrast, during exact calculation, approximation and mental rotation tasks that demand the use of more complex problem solving strategies, different activation patterns were observed between men and women. In particular, women showed additional activation in bilateral temporal, right inferior frontal and primary motor areas. These results indicate that women use cognitive strategies that involve brain areas for spatial and verbal working memory and speech/head-motor mechanisms while solving mental rotation and number related problems.

VMental rotation and the motor system: Embodiment head over heels __ We examined whether body parts attached to abstract stimuli automatically force embodiment in a mental rotation task. In Experiment 1, standard cube combinations reflecting a human pose were added with (1) body parts on anatomically possible locations, (2) body parts on anatomically impossible locations, (3) colored end cubes, and (4) simple end cubes. Participants (N = 30) had to decide whether two simultaneously presented stimuli, rotated in the picture plane, were identical or not. They were fastest and made less errors in the possible-body condition, but were slowest and least accurate in the impossible-body condition. A second experiment (N = 32) replicated the results and ruled out that the poor performance in the impossible-body condition was due to the specific stimulus material. The findings of both experiments suggest that body parts automatically trigger embodiment, even when it is counterproductive and dramatically impairs performance, as in the impossible-body condition. It can furthermore be concluded that body parts cannot be used flexibly for spatial orientation in mental rotation tasks, compared to colored end cubes. Thus, embodiment appears to be a strong and inflexible mechanism that may, under certain conditions, even impede performance.

VObservations of solar cyclical variations in geocoronal H\u03b1 column emission intensities __ Observations of thermospheric + exospheric H\u03b1 column emissions by the Wisconsin H\u03b1 Mapper (WHAM) Fabry\u2010Perot (Kitt Peak, Arizona) over the 1997\u20132001 rise in solar cycle 23 show a statistically significant solar cyclical variation. The higher signal\u2010to\u2010noise WHAM observations corroborate suggestions of a solar cycle trend in the H\u03b1 emissions seen in Wisconsin observations over solar cycle 22. Here we compare WHAM 1997 and 2000\u20132001 winter solstice geocoronal H\u03b1 observations toward regions of the sky with low galactic emission. The observed variation in geocoronal hydrogen column emission intensities over the solar cycle is small compared with variations in hydrogen exobase densities. Higher H\u03b1 emissions are seen during solar maximum periods of the solar cycle. At a mid range shadow altitude (3000 km), WHAM geocoronal H\u03b1 intensities are about 45% higher during solar maximum than during solar minimum.

VMental Images and the Brain __ One theory of visual mental imagery posits that early visual cortex is also used to support representations during imagery. This claim is important because it bears on the 'imagery debate': Early visual cortex supports depictive representations during perception, not descriptive ones. Thus, if such cortex also plays a functional role in imagery, this is strong evidence that imagery does not rely exclusively on the same sorts of representations that underlie language. The present article first outlines the nature of a processing system in which such a dual use of early visual cortex (in perception and in imagery) makes sense. Following this, literature bearing on the claim that early visual cortex is used in visual mental imagery is reviewed, and key issues are discussed.

VThe Effects of High School Geometry Instruction on the Performance in Spatial Tasks __ The present study explores the effect of school geometry instruction on spatial ability. We tested 282 students of varying mathematical background looking for differences in their performance on a variety of spatial abilities. The spatial tasks were confined to those relevant to basic concepts of formal geometry, in order to investigate whether these differences would be more conspicuous. Moreover, we interviewed 36 students to examine the relationship between the strategies they employed and the geometry instruction they had experienced in school. The results of our analysis suggest that the school geometry experience positively contributes to the students' spatial abilities.

VDevelopment of Spatial Ability According to Mental Rotation Test at SKF and YBL __ The Mental Rotation Test (MRT) is one of the tests to survey the spatial ability. In this article we make an attempt to measure the spatial abilities of the students of wood industrial engineering and industrial design engineering of the Simonyi Károly Faculty of Engineering, Wood Sciences and Applied Arts (SKF for short) of the University of West Hungary and compare the results with the architects students of the Ybl Miklós Faculty of Architecture and Civil Engineering of the Szent István University. The paper aims to compare the results with respect to the scores and mainly the improvement based on new examination aspects. The article concludes that the small differences in the students\u2019 developments of spatial ability in the two institutions can be caused by the difference in Descriptive Geometry courses.

VImagining rotation by endogenous versus exogenous forces: Distinct neural mechanisms __ Previous neuroimaging studies of mental image transformations have sometimes implicated motor processes and sometimes not. In this study, prior to neuroimaging the subjects either viewed an electric motor rotating an angular object, or they rotated the object manually. Following this, they performed the identical mental rotation task in which they compared members of pairs of such figures, but were asked to imagine the figures rotating as they had just seen the model rotate. When results from the two rotation conditions were directly compared, motor cortex (including area M1) was found to be activated only when subjects imagined the rotations as a consequence of manual activity. Thus, there are at least two, qualitatively distinct, ways to imagine objects rotating in images, and these different strategies can be adopted voluntarily.

VIndividual Differences in Mental Rotation __ Two experiments tested the hypothesis that imagery ability and figural complexity interact to affect the choice of mental rotation strategies. Participants performed the Shepard and Metzler (1971) mental rotation task. On half of the trials, the 3-D figures were manipulated to create \u201cfragmented\u201d figures, with some cubes missing. Good imagers were less accurate and had longer response times on fragmented figures than on complete figures. Poor imagers performed similarly on fragmented and complete figures. These results suggest that good imagers use holistic mental rotation strategies by default, but switch to alternative strategies depending on task demands, whereas poor imagers are less flexible and use piecemeal strategies regardless of the task demands.

VHuman sex differences in cognition, fact, not predicament __ Sex differences in cognition are not trivial nor have the most salient differences declined over the last three decades. There is compelling evidence that sex hormones are a major influence in the organization, and perhaps the maintenance, of cognitive sex differences. Anatomical brain differences are also well established, though we have yet to associate these firmly with the cognitive sex differences. While it is reasonable to question the specifics of the traditional hunter-gatherer evolutionary schema, it is argued that it remains valuable in providing a paradigm for understanding human sex-differentiated behaviour, since it is capable of generating hypotheses that can be tested.

VInteractions between the dorsal and the ventral pathways in mental rotation: An fMRI study __ In this fMRI study, we examined the relationship between activations in the inferotemporal region (ventral pathway) and the parietal region (dorsal pathway), as well as in the prefrontal cortex (associated with working memory), in a modified mental rotation task. We manipulated figural complexity (simple vs. complex) to affect the figure recognition process (associated with the ventral pathway) and the amount of rotation (0° vs. 90°), typically associated with the dorsal pathway. The pattern of activation not only showed that both streams are affected by both manipulations, but also showed an overadditive interaction. The effect of figural complexity was greater for 90° rotation than for 0° in multiple regions, including the ventral, dorsal, and prefrontal regions. In addition, functional connectivity analyses on the correlations across the time courses of activation between regions of interest showed increased synchronization among multiple brain areas as task demand increased. The results indicate that both the dorsal and the ventral pathways show interactive effects of object and spatial processing, and they suggest that multiple regions interact to perform mental rotation.

VMental rotation and visual familiarity __ Mental rotation functions often evidence a curvilinear trend indicating relative indifference to small departures from the upright. In Experiment 1, this was true only for normal letters whereas reflected letters yielded a largely linear rotation function. This suggested that the internal representation of familiar visual patterns is characterized by broad orientation tuning that allows recognition despite small disorientations. Since familiar stimuli are often encountered slightly tilted from the upright, broad orientation tuning may reflect this ecological distribution. Experiment 2, however, indicated the possible involvement of two additional processes. Subjects were first trained on unfamiliar nonsense characters that appeared only in their \u201cupright\u201d positions. This was followed by a normal-reflected mental rotation task on these characters. Initially, rotation functions were more curvilinear for normal than for reflected characters. This suggested that practice with upright stimuli automatically contributes to broad tuning. Further practice resulted in a curvilinear trend for reflected characters as well, despite the fact that they appeared with equal probability in all orientations. This suggested that the very process of mentally rotating stimuli to the upright orientation increases insensitivity to slight departures from this orientation. Experiment 3 established that the different functions found for normal and reflected characters were due to stimulus rather than response factors.

VPain and the body schema __ Some accounts of body representations postulate a real-time representation of the body in space generated by proprioceptive, somatosensory, vestibular and other sensory inputs; this representation has often been termed the `body schema'. To examine whether the body schema is influenced by peripheral factors such as pain, we asked patients with chronic unilateral arm pain to determine the laterality of pictured hands presented at different orientations. Previous chronometric findings suggest that performance on this task depends on the body schema, in that it appears to involve mentally rotating one's hand from its current position until it is aligned with the stimulus hand. We found that, as in previous investigations, participants' response times (RTs) reflected the degree of simulated movement as well as biomechanical constraints of the arm. Importantly, a significant interaction between the magnitude of mental rotation and limb was observed: RTs were longer for the painful arm than for the unaffected arm for large-amplitude imagined movements; controls exhibited symmetrical RTs. These findings suggest that the body schema is influenced by pain and that this task may provide an objective measure of pain.

VEye Tracking and Gaze Based Interaction within Immersive Virtual Environments __ Abstract: Our eyes are input sensors which provide our brains with streams of visual data. They have evolved to be extremely efficient, and they will constantly dart to-and-fro to rapidly build up a picture of the salient entities in a viewed scene. These actions are almost subconscious. However, they can provide telling signs of how the brain is decoding the visuals, and can indicate emotional responses, prior to the viewer becoming aware of them. In this paper we discuss a method of tracking a user\u2019s eye movements, and use these to calculate their gaze within an immersive virtual environment. We investigate how these gaze patterns can be captured and used to identify viewed virtual objects, and discuss how this can be used as a natural method of interacting with the Virtual Environment. We describe a flexible tool that has been developed to achieve this, and detail initial validating applications that prove the concept.

VLegal issues in prescription writing: A study of two health institutions in Nigeria __ Objectives This study examined the degree of deviation (from both World Health Organization (WHO) specifications and the particular institution's specifications) on the part of prescribers in adequately filling prescription forms and the legal implications of such deviations for the prescriber and the institution. Methods The study was carried out at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex (OAUTHC) and Obafemi Awolowo University Health Centre, Ife\u2010Ife, Nigeria. The Teaching Hospital is a 1000\u2010bed tertiary health care facility that serves as a training centre for health professionals. The Health Centre is a 25\u2010bed health care facility. A random sample of prescriptions received from the Pharmacy Department of the OAUTHC and the Obafemi Awolowo University Health Centre were analysed. Key findings For the Teaching Hospital, the prescriber's name and signature were on 80 and 96% of the prescriptions, respectively, whereas all prescriptions from the Health Centre contained this information. For the Teaching Hospital, 100, 1.8, 93.8 and 98.4% of prescriptions contained the patient's name, address and age, and the date, respectively, whereas 99.6, 86.4 and 99.9% of prescriptions from the Health Centre contained patient code number, age and the date respectively. The precentages of completely filled prescriptions for the Teaching Hospital and the Health Centre were 1.3 and 85.9% respectively. Prescription patterns for the major drug classes in both institutions were compared and related to the level of deviation from the ideal prescription\u2010writing specifications of the WHO. Conclusions The legal implications of non\u2010compliance with WHO standards in prescription writing are discussed, with appropriate recommendations.

VSecond to fourth digit ratio and male ability in sport: implications for sexual selection in humans __ Fetal and adult testosterone may be important in establishing and maintaining sex-dependent abilities associated with male physical competitiveness. There is evidence that the ratio of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (2D:4D) is a negative correlate of prenatal and adult testosterone. We use ability in sports, and particularly ability in football, as a proxy for male physical competitiveness. Compared to males with high 2D:4D ratio, men with low ratio reported higher attainment in a range of sports and had higher mental rotation scores (a measure of visual\u2013spatial ability). Professional football players had lower 2D:4D ratios than controls. Football players in 1st team squads had lower 2D:4D than reserves or youth team players. Men who had represented their country had lower ratios than those who had not, and there was a significant (one-tailed) negative association between 2D:4D and number of international appearances after the effect of country was removed. We suggest that prenatal and adult testosterone promotes the development and maintenance of traits which are useful in sports and athletics disciplines and in male:male fighting.

VMental rotation of random two-dimensional shapes __ Two experiments are reported in which Ss were required to determine whether a random, angular form, presented at any of a number of picture-plane orientations, was a \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201creflected\u201d version. Average time required to make this determination increased linearly with the angular departure of the form from a previously learned orientation. The slope and intercept of the reaction-time (RT) function were virtually constant, regardless of the perceptual complexity of the test form and the orientation selected for initial learning. When Ss were informed in advance as to the identity and the orientation of the upcoming test form and, further, were permitted to indicate when they were prepared for its external presentation, RT for determining the version of the form was constant for all test-form orientations. However, the time needed to prepare for the test-form presentation increased linearly with the angular departure of the form from the learned orientation. It is argued that the processes both of preparing for and of responding to a disoriented test form consist of the mental rotation of an image, and that both sorts of mental rotation (pre-stimulus and post-stimulus) are carried out at essentially the same constant rate.

VMenstrual Cycle Variation in Spatial Ability: Relation to Salivary Cortisol Levels __ This study examined whether menstrual cycle phase was associated with performance on the Primary Mental Abilities Test of Spatial Relations, a test of mental rotation, in undergraduate students (N = 82). As cortisol levels also vary across the menstrual cycle under conditions of stress and influence cognitive performance, saliva samples were obtained before and after the test session to examine whether cortisol levels were related to between- and within-group differences in spatial performance. Men scored higher on the spatial test than all the groups of women, although the difference between men and women in the menstrual phase was not significant. Women in the luteal phase scored lower than the menstrual, follicular, and oral contraceptive user groups of women. There were no sex or menstrual cycle differences in cortisol levels, and no association between cortisol levels and spatial performance. The poorer performance of women in the luteal phase was not related to differences in ratings of perceived stress, perceived success on the test, or mood. Although menstrual cycle phase accounted for a significant proportion of the variance (15%) in performance on the spatial test, this does not explain why men outperformed women regardless of the phase of the cycle. Thus, there are clearly several other variables, sociocultural and physiological, involved in mediating individual differences in spatial performance.

VPeptide ladder sequencing by mass spectrometry using a novel, volatile degradation reagent __ A conceptually novel approach to protein sequencing involves the generation of ragged\u2010end polypeptide chains followed by mass spectroscopic analysis of the resulting nested set of fragments. We report here on the synthesis and development of a volatile isothiocyanate (trifluoroethylisothiocyanate) that allows the identification of several consecutive residues starting with a few picomoles of peptide. The nested set of peptides is generated simply by adding equal aliquots of starting peptide each cycle and driving both the coupling and cleavage reactions to completion. No additional reagents are required to act as chain terminators and retention of the peptide terminal amine allows for subsequent modification with quaternary ammonium alkyl NHS esters to improve sensitivity. Complex washing procedures are not required each cycle, as reagents and by\u2010products are efficiently removed under vacuum, eliminating extractive loss. Multiple peptide samples can be processed simultaneously, with each degradation cycle completed in 35\u201340 min. The inherent simplicity of the process should allow for easy automation and permit rapid processing of samples in parallel.

VPure Topographical Disorientation Related to Dysfunction of the Viewpoint Dependent Visual System __ A 70-year-old woman presented with pure topographical disorientation following haemorrhage in the right medial parietal lobe. She could not navigate in the real world despite good ability to draw maps, describe routes, and identify objects and buildings. Her performance on mental rotation, visual memory, and spatial learning tests also was normal. In contrast, she failed totally in a locomotor map test and in a task in which she was requested to judge viewpoints of buildings. Her highly selective topographical disorientation was probably caused by the inability to identify a viewpoint of a particular building. The lesion may have disconnected the association between the spatial information processed in the lateral parietal lobe and the visual memory mediated by the limbic system, which seems to be important for viewpoint dependent analysis.

VLow levels of physical activity in back pain patients are associated with high levels of fear\u2010avoidance beliefs and pain catastrophizing __ Background and Purpose.\u2002Fear\u2010avoidance beliefs are important determinants for disability in patients with non\u2010specific low\u2010back pain (LBP). The association with self\u2010reported level of physical activity is less known. The aim of the present study was to describe the level of physical activity in patients with chronic non\u2010specific LBP and its relation to fear\u2010avoidance beliefs and pain catastrophizing. Method.\u2002A cross\u2010sectional study on 64 patients with chronic non\u2010specific LBP in primary healthcare. The variables measured and the questionnaires used were: level of physical activity (six\u2010graded scale); activity limitations (Roland Morris Disability Questionnare (RDQ)); fear\u2010avoidance beliefs (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) 13\u2010item and sub\u2010scales \u2018activity avoidance\u2019 and \u2018somatic focus\u2019); and pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)). The level of physical activity was dichotomised into low and high physical activity. Individual median scores on the TSK and PCS scales were used to group the patients into different levels of fear\u2010avoidance beliefs and pain catastrophizing. Univariate logistic regressions were used to calculate odds ratios for having low physical activity. Results.\u2002Patients with low physical activity had significantly higher scores in fear\u2010avoidance beliefs and pain catastrophizing (p < 0.05). Odds ratios for low level of physical activity were between 4 and 8 (p < 0.05) for patients with high fear\u2010avoidance beliefs or medium/high pain catastrophizing. Conclusions.\u2002This study indicates that it seems important for physiotherapists in primary care to measure levels of fear\u2010avoidance beliefs or pain catastrophizing. In particular, the two subscales of the TSK could be of real value for clinicians when making treatment decisions concerning physical exercise therapy for patients with chronic LBP.

VMicrowave and radiofrequency properties of high-Tc thin films __ Impedance investigations of oriented thin film YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 deposited onto SrTiO3 single crystal substrate in both microwave and radiofrequency fields have been performed. Characteristic features of a temperature dependence of electromagnetic energy absorption were found at T < Tco, where Tco is temperature of the superconducting transition onset. These peculiarities are explained in terms of a size effect earlier found in ceramic samples being in the radiofrequency field. The values of Rs and \u03bb(O) were estimated in the microwave range. Measurements carried out half a year later point to changes of the thin film properties. Herewith, the increase of Tco has been noted.

VComplement activation after ischemia-reperfusion in human liver allografts: Incidence and pathophysiological relevance __ BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the occurrence and possible consequences of local complement activation in human liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to search for signs of complement activation in human liver allografts and evaluate their relationship to cell injury and leukocyte sequestration.METHODS: In 33 postreperfusion biopsy specimens, 9 preoperative specimens, and 10 intraoperative specimens, the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement was localized, expression of complement inhibitors was evaluated, and intragraft accumulation of leukocytes and platelets was quantitated.RESULTS: In control samples and preoperative biopsy specimens, the membrane attack complex was detected only in extracellular deposits, associated with its soluble inhibitors clusterin and vitronectin. Comparable observations were performed in 14 postoperative specimens. In the remaining 19 postoperative specimens, membrane attack complex decorated a variable proportion of hepatocytes. The extent of membrane attack complex deposition correlated with the increase in postoperative aspartate aminotransferase levels in serum (P = 0.002) and the decrease in postoperative factor V levels in serum (P = 0.002). It also correlated with the number of leukocytes and platelets accumulating within the graft (P < or = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Local complement activation is frequent during human liver transplantation and probably contributes to cell injury and leukocyte sequestration in the allograft.(Gastroenterology 1997 Mar;112(3):908-18)

VCurrent issues in directional motor control __ Many studies during the past 15 years have shown that the direction of motor output (movement or isometric force) is an important factor for neuronal activity in the motor cortex, both at the level of single cells and at the level of neuronal populations. Recent studies have investigated several new aspects of this problem including the effect of posture, the relations to time-varying movement parameters (for example, position, velocity and acceleration) and the cortical representation of memorized simple movements and complex-movement trajectories. Furthermore, the neural correlates of directional operations, such as mental rotation and memory-scanning of visuomotor directions, have also been investigated. In addition, neural networks have been used to model dynamic, time-varying, spatial motor trajectories.

VBetween Virtues and Blessings: A Discussion on Zhang Jiucheng\u2019s Thoughts __ As an important thinker in the early South Song dynasty, Zhang Jiucheng differed in his thinking from the School of Principles of the Song and Ming dynasties, which was the mainstream at that time, and was thus excluded by Zhu Xi and his followers. The relation between virtues and blessings was a characteristic part of Zhang\u2019s thought. By analyzing concepts like Heavenly mandates, virtues, blessings, luckiness and unluckiness in Zhang\u2019s thought, this essay re-defines the complicated but manifest relations between virtues and blessings; clarifies the trajectory of Zhang\u2019s thoughts on Heavenly mandates, virtues, and blessings; and displays the efforts of the Neo-Confucians of the Song dynasties to stress the value of human nature in the tension between Heavenly mandates and virtues.

VThe B7/CD28 costimulatory family in autoimmunity __ Summary:\u2002 Host defense is dependent on the appropriate induction of immune responses. A central concept in immunology is the ability of the immune system to differentiate foreign from self\u2010antigens. The failure of the immune response to recognize foreign pathogens can result in infection and disease in the host. The inappropriate response of the immune system to self\u2010antigens is equally problematic, leading to autoimmune disease. Central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms control self\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses and protect peripheral tissues from autoimmune attack. This review examines the roles of B7/CD28 family members, which can augment or antagonize T\u2010cell receptor signaling, in the regulation of central and peripheral T\u2010cell tolerance. We also discuss how B7/CD28 pathways influence both T\u2010cell\u2010intrinsic and \u2010extrinsic mechanisms of regulation.

VTestosterone levels and spatial ability in men __ Testosterone (T) levels were measured by salivary assays in 59 males at times of the day when T was expected to be highest and lowest. Relationships were evaluated for mean hormone levels across the two sessions and hormone level changes between sessions with performance on three-dimensional mental rotations, a spatial test which customarily favours males. An anagrams task and the digit symbol test were used as controls. Mental rotations scores showed a significant positive relationship with mean T levels but not with changes in T. There were no significant relationships between control test scores and mean T levels. Findings are discussed in terms of their contributions to the resolution of ambiguities in prior reported data.

VMotor processes in children's imagery: the case of mental rotation of hands __ In a mental rotation task, children 5 and 6 years of age and adults had to decide as quickly as possible if a photograph of a hand showed a left or a right limb. The visually presented hands were left and right hands in palm or in back view, presented in four different angles of rotation. Participants had to give their responses with their own hands either in a regular, palms\u2010down posture or in an inverted, palms\u2010up posture. For both children and adults, variation of the posture of their own hand had a significant effect. Reaction times were longer the more awkward it was to bring their own hand into the position shown in the stimulus photograph. These results, together with other converging evidence, strongly suggest that young children's kinetic imagery is guided by motor processes, even more so than adults\u2019.

VComparison of the efficacy and cost effectiveness of pre-emptive therapy as directed by CMV antigenemia and prophylaxis with ganciclovir in lung transplant recipients __ Background: CMV disease remains a major complication of lung transplantation and attempts to prevent it have met with marginal success. In a previous study we documented that universal prophylaxis did not prevent CMV disease but merely delayed it, and was very costly.Methods We compared the efficacy and cost of pre-emptive therapy with ganciclovir, guided by CMV antigenemia, to that of historic controls that received universal prophylaxis with ganciclovir. CMV antigenemia assay was done routinely and pre-emptive therapy was initiated if greater than 25 CMV positive cells per 100,000 polymorphonuclear cells were found.Results Nineteen patients were enrolled; 6 of whom received 12 courses of pre-emptive therapy. The incidence of CMV disease was 26% compared to 38% for the historical controls (p = 0.51). None of the patients that received pre-emptive therapy developed CMV disease following that therapy. Antigenemia failed to predict disease in 5 patients that developed it, and thus it is unknown if pre-emptive therapy could have prevented it. There was no mortality in either the study patients or historic controls directly related to CMV. The net savings with pre-emptive therapy was $2569 per patient.Conclusion We conclude that pre-emptive therapy with ganciclovir is as safe and effective as universal prophylaxis in preventing CMV disease in lung transplant recipients, and is less expensive. The appropriate surveillance technique and timing remain to be determine to optimize the efficacy of pre-emptive therapy.

VProduction of ultra slow antiprotons, its application to atomic collisions and atomic spectroscopy \u2013 ASACUSA project __ The Atomic Spectroscopy And Collisions Using Slow Antiprotons (ASACUSA) project aims at studying collision dynamics with slow antiprotons and high precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic atoms. To realize these purposes, the production of high quality ultra slow antiproton beams is essential, which is achieved by the combination of antiproton decelerator (AD) from 3 GeV to 5 MeV, a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) decelerator from 5 MeV to 50 keV, and finally an electromagnetic trap from 50 keV to 10 eV. From the atomic physics point of view, an antiproton is an extremely heavy electron and/or a negatively charged proton, i.e., the antiproton is a unique tool to shed light on collision dynamics from the other side of the world. In addition to this fundamentally important feature, the antiproton has also a big practical advantage, i.e., it annihilates with the target nuclei emitting several energetic pions, which provides high detection efficiency with very good time resolution. Many-body effects which are of great importance to several branches of science will be studied through ionization and antiprotonic atom formation processes under single collision conditions. Various antiprotonic atoms including protonium ( p \u0304p) are expected to be meta-stable in vacuum, which is never true for those in dense media except for antiprotonic helium. High precision spectroscopy of protonium will for the first time become feasible benefited by this meta-stability. The present review reports briefly the production scheme of ultra slow antiproton beams and several topics proposed in the ASACUSA project.

VSynthesis of High Aspect Ratio PbBi4Ti4O15 and Topochemical Conversion to PbTiO3\u2010Based Microplatelets __ Perovskite microplatelets of the composition 0.4(Na1/2Bi1/2) TiO3\u20130.6PbTiO3 (0.4NBT\u20130.6PT) were synthesized by topochemical conversion of the Aurivillius phase PbBi4Ti4O15 in a NaCl/Bi2O3/PbO flux system. To facilitate morphologic control, we investigate the effects of TiO2 particle size on molten salt growth of the PbBi4Ti4O15 phase. We find that the initial nucleation density and [100] thickness of this phase are controlled by the TiO2 dissolution rate, while the platelet diameter is determined by Ostwald ripening. PbBi4Ti4O15 microplatelets produced using these methods can be converted entirely to a tetragonal perovskite phase (c/a=1.051) while retaining the dimensions of the precursor PbBi4Ti4O15 phase. We propose that the resulting 0.4NBT\u20130.6PT composition is favored thermodynamically due to the lower free energy of this composition relative to pure PbTiO3. In addition, partial (Na1/2Bi1/2)TiO3 substitution is kinetically favored as it reduces A\u2010site diffusion during the topochemical conversion process.

VSex differences in cognitive abilities: A cross-cultural perspective __ Studies in Western cultures have indicated significant sex differences in certain cognitive abilities. To determine whether similar differences occur in a non-Western culture, this study administered a cross-linguistic battery of tests to high school students in Japan and America. In both cultures, girls averaged significantly higher scores on a Story Recall test, the Digit-Symbol test and a Word Fluency test whereas boys achieved significantly higher scores on a Mental Rotation test. The analysis of standardized test scores further indicated that the size of the sex difference was culture-independent in three out of these four cases. These results are discussed in the context of the Geschwind and Galaburda [Cerebral Lateralization. Biological Mechanisms, Associations and Pathology, Bradford Books, Cambridge, Massachusetts] account of the contribution of testosterone to left\u2014right asymmetries in early cerebral development.

VA model for enterprise portal management __ The article identifies the risks and challenges of using enterprise portal technology for managing corporate information and knowledge. Many of the risks and challenges are attributed to the inherent limitations of the software solutions for information and knowledge management. It is argued that the risks of adverse effects from the inherent limitations of artificial agents can be reduced if the technical solution, i.e. the portal architecture, is embedded into adequate relational human architecture. The article proposes a management model for enterprise portals analogous to the management model for newspaper production, and argues that the model provides the adequate organizational structure for overcoming the inherent limitations of enterprise portals.

VConverging Evidence for Domain-Specific Slowing From Multiple Nonlexical Tasks and Multiple Analytic Methods __ Older and young adults were tested on eight nonlexical tasks that overlapped extensively in complexity: disjunctive choice reaction time, line-length discrimination, letter classification, shape classification, mental rotation, visual search, abstract matching, and mental paper-folding. Performance on the first seven tasks was associated with equivalently low error rates in both groups, making it possible to directly compare their response times (RTs) on these tasks. Consistent with domain-specific slowing, the relationship between the RTs of the older adults and the RTs of the young adults was well described by a task-independent mathematical (Brinley) function. Evidence from this analysis and from analyses based on task-specific information-processing models leads to similar conclusions and provides converging support for general cognitive slowing in the nonlexical domain.

VIn Vitro Model for Developmental Progression from Vasculogenesis to Angiogenesis with a Murine Endothelial Precursor Cell Line, MFLM-4 __ In the embryo, vascular networks are developed through both vasculogenesis, the assembly of vessels from endothelial progenitor cells or hemangioblasts, and angiogenesis, the sprouting of vessels from preexisting capillaries. Cell culture models using endothelial cells (EC) and various extracellular matrix components have been useful in understanding the cellular and molecular factors involved in angiogenesis. However, there are few models of vasculogenesis. Using a murine endothelial precursor cell line, MFLM-4, derived from e14.5 lung mesenchyme, we have developed a culture system that not only recapitulates many of the characteristics of vasculogenesis but also progresses into angiogenesis. By 8 h, MFLM-4 cultured on the basement membrane preparation Matrigel invade the matrix, coalesce, and assemble into large clusters of cells resembling blood islands. During vascular development, blood islands are the focal areas for coalescence of endothelial precursors. For MFLM-4, this phase of in vitro vasculogenic clustering does not require proliferation. If proliferation is not blocked, MFLM-4 progresses into an angiogenic phase with the clusters forming multicell angiogenic sprouts. Through 3 days of culture, lumens form within the clusters, adjacent clusters are connected with tube-like structures, and eventually an extensive network or plexus of clusters connected by capillary-like tubes is formed. MFLM-4 cultured on Matrigel provides an in vitro system for analysis of the multistage, concurrent processes of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.

VCommon processing constraints for visuomotor and visual mental rotations __ Abstract: Naive human subjects were tested in three different tasks: (1) a visuomotor mental rotation task, in which the subjects were instructed to move a cursor at a given angle from a stimulus direction; (2) a visual mental rotation task, in which the subjects had to decide whether a displayed letter was normal or mirror image regardless of its orientation in the plane of presentation; and (3) a visuomotor memory scanning task, in which a list of two to five stimuli directions were presented sequentially and then one of the stimuli (test stimulus), except the last one, was presented again. Subjects were instructed to move a cursor in the direction of the stimulus that followed the test stimulus in the previous sequence. The processing rate of each subject in each task was estimated using the linear relation between the response time and the angle (mental rotation tasks) or the list length (memory scanning task). We found that the processing rates in the mental rotation tasks were significantly correlated but that neither correlated significantly with the processing rate in the memory scanning task. These results suggest that visuomotor and visual mental rotations share common processing constraints that cannot be ascribed to general mental processing performances.

VMultiple Hypothalamic Factors Regulate Pyroglutamyl Peptidase II in Cultures of Adenohypophyseal Cells: Role of the cAMP Pathway __ In the adenohypophysis, thyrotrophin\u2010releasing hormone (TRH) is inactivated by pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII), a TRH\u2010specific ectoenzyme localized in lactotrophs. TRH slowly downregulates surface PPII activity in adenohypophyseal cell cultures. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation mimics this effect. We tested the hypothesis that other hypothalamic factors controlling prolactin secretion could also regulate PPII activity in adenohypophyseal cell cultures. Incubation for 16\u2003h with pituitary adenylate cyclase activator peptide 38 (PACAP; 10\u22126\u2003M) decreased PPII activity. Bromocryptine (10\u22128\u2003M), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, or somatostatin (10\u22126\u2003M) stimulated enzyme activity and blocked the inhibitory effect of [3\u2010Me\u2010His2]\u2010TRH, a TRH receptor agonist. Bromocryptine and somatostatin actions were suppressed by preincubation with pertussis toxin (400\u2003ng ml\u22121). Because these hypophysiotropic factors transduce some of their effects using the cAMP pathway, we analysed its role on PPII regulation. Cholera toxin (400\u2003ng ml\u22121) inhibited PPII activity. Forskolin (10\u22126\u2003M) caused a time\u2010dependent decrease in PPII activity, with maximal inhibition at 12\u201316\u2003h treatment; ED50 was 10\u22127 M. 3\u2010isobutyl\u20101\u2010methylxanthine or dibutiryl cAMP, caused a dose\u2010dependent inhibition of PPII activity. These data suggest that increased cAMP down\u2010regulates PPII activity. The effect of PACAP was blocked by preincubation with H89 (10\u22126 M), a protein kinase A inhibitor, suggesting that the cAMP pathway mediates some of the effects of PACAP. Maximal effects of forskolin and 12\u2010O\u2010tetradecanoylphorbol 13\u2010acetate were additive. PPII activity, therefore, is independently regulated by the cAMP and PKC pathways. Because most treatments inhibited PPII mRNA levels similarly to PPII activity, an important level of control of PPII activity by these factors may be at the mRNA level. We suggest that PPII is subject to \u2018homologous\u2019 and \u2018heterologous\u2019 regulation by elements of the multifactorial system that controls prolactin secretion.

VReduction of maxillary molars in Homo sapiens sapiens: A different perspective __ Crown and cusp areas, and buccolingual and mesiodistal diameters of maxillary molars of complete upper tooth rows (30 males, 30 females) were analysed in order to quantify changes in size and shape from the first to the third molar. Uni\u2010 and multivariate analyses revealed the mesial cusps, in particular the protocone (mesiolingual cusp), to be more stable than the other cusps. Although there is a gradient in size from the first to third molar, shape changes were found to be marked. Overall, the findings are in keeping with the field theory and the hypotheses of environmental constraints on later developing teeth. However, not all of the results could be entirely explained by these concepts. Functional aspects seem to account for the relative stability of the protocone and the buccolingual crown diameter. It appears that this functional complex is relatively stable despite the overall reduction of tooth size, which is probably secondary to processes occurring in the jaws and the cranium. This finding may have implications for studies on tooth reduction between populations of different time periods.

VDifferent cortical activation patterns in blind and sighted humans during encoding and transformation of haptic images __ In this study, we investigated whether the occipital cortex of blind humans is activated during haptic perception and/or transformation of a haptic image. Slow event\u2010related brain potentials were monitored from 18 electrodes in 12 sighted and 15 congenitally blind participants while they were engaged in a haptic mental rotation task. In both groups, slow negative shifts appeared over (a) the frontal cortex at the beginning of each processing episode, (b) the left\u2010central to parietal cortex during encoding and maintaining of a haptic image, and (c) the central to parietal cortex during image transformation. A pronounced slow negative potential over the occipital cortex emerged only in the blind individuals and was time\u2010locked to the processing epochs. Its amplitude increased with the amount of processing load. The slow wave effects observed in the blind individuals could indicate that occipital areas participate in specific, nonvisual functions or they could reflect a coactivation of these areas whenever the activation level of task\u2010specific processing modules located elsewhere in the cortex is raised by nonspecific thalamocortical input.

VBayesian Equilibrium in a Public Good Economy __ This paper studies the provision of a public good via voluntary contributions in an economy with uncertainty and differential information. Consumers differ in their private information regarding their future endowment as well as in their preferences. Each consumer selects her consumption\u2002ex ante, i.e., before knowing the state of nature. Contributions to the provision of the public good are determined\u2002ex post, i.e., when the state of nature is realized. Assuming that some normality conditions hold, a Bayesian equilibrium exists. Further, equilibrium is unique, regardless of the number of consumers, when either (1) the information partitions of consumers can be ranked from the finest to the coarsest, or (2) there are only two types of consumers.

VMENTAL ROTATION AND TEMPORAL CONTINGENCIES __ A task that requires subjects to determine whether two forms of the same shape, but in different orientations, are mirror images or identical except for orientation is called a handedness recognition task. Subjects' reaction times (RT) on this task are consistently related to the angular disparity (termed a) between the two presented forms. This pattern of data has been interpreted to indicate that subjects solve the task by imagining that one of the forms rotates into the orientation of the other (termed mental rotation). The speed with which one imagines one of the forms rotating has been widely considered a fixed capability of the individual, and thus immune to the effect of contingencies. We present an experiment that assesses the effects of temporal contingencies in a handedness recognition task on the slope of the function RT = f(\u03b1). The data indicate that the slope of this function can come under the control of temporal contingencies.

V\u03b2 -Thalassaemia/haemoglobin E tissue ferritins __ Summary: Ferritins from liver and spleen of both\u03b2-thalassaemia/haemoglobin E (HbE) and non-thalassaemic patients were purified by heating a methanol-treated homogenate, followed by molecular exclusion chromatography. The concentrations of ferritins in the\u03b2-thalassaemia/HbE liver and spleen were calculated as 3.8 and 2.0 mg/g wet tissue. The\u03b2-thalassaemia/HbE ferritin iron/protein ratios were higher than those of normal ferritins. On PAGE, all ferritins gave a single major monomeric band with only very small differences in their mobility. Ferritins from thalassaemic patients also possessed bands corresponding to oligomers. On SDS/PAGE, all ferritins were resolved into two major subunits: H and L with L subunit predominating. While the isoferritin profiles of ferritins from\u03b2-thalassaemia/HbE liver and spleen were similar to each other and to those of normal liver and spleen, some extra bands were present in the acidic region. The microstructure of these pathological ferritins appears to result, to a large degree, from the particular nature and amount of iron loading present.

VEvent-related potentials during arithmetic and mental rotation __ In separate studies of arithmetic and mental rotation, similar posterior negative slow waves have been found. This similarity was surprising given the difference in cognitive processing required by these tasks. Furthermore, delayed responses were employed in these studies, so that it was not possible to determine the extent to which the slow wave activity was too late to be associated with processing that was specific to performance of the tasks. This experiment was intended to clarify the task-specific and non-specific nature of the slow wave activity. Subjects performed either an arithmetic or mental rotation task at two levels of difficulty on a random, trial-to-trial basis and gave an immediate response.There were a number of late posterior negativities, each with a different timing and topography, which were sensitive to type of task and/or task difficulty. Some components were associated with early task processing that was synchronized to the stimulus while others, revealed by response-synchronized averaging, were associated with later stages of task processing. There also was post-task activity that was sensitive to the difficulty level of the prior operations. In both tasks, there was a pre-frontal positive wave that persisted over most of the pre-response epoch, evidently related to a process that was active throughout the task. There also was centro-frontal phasic negativity, with a large peak at 380 msec in mental rotation, and a smaller, longer latency peak in arithmetic, apparently related to the complexity of the stimulus.Thus we conclude that arithmetic and mental rotation each elicit task-specific slow wave activity.

VHierarchical shape fitting using an iterated linear filter __ In this paper we describe an efficient method for fitting a prior linear shape model to image data using a Kalman filter framework. This work extends previous methods in several significant respects. Firstly, the dimensionality of our shape representation is varied dynamically to reflect the available information at the current search scale so that more shape parameters are used as the fitting process converges. A coarse to fine sampling strategy is used so that the computational expense of the initial few iterations is much reduced. Finally, we re-examine the aperture problem and show how the conventional use of searching along normals to the estimated curve can be improved upon.

VTopographic differences of slow event-related brain potentials in blind and sighted adult human subjects during haptic mental rotation __ Twelve blindfolded sighted, nine congenitally blind, and seven adventitiously blind subjects were tested in a haptic mental rotation task while slow event-related potentials in the EEG were recorded from 17 scalp locations. The overall topography of the slow wave pattern which prevailed during the task differed for sighted and for blind, but not for congenitally and adventitiously blind subjects. While the tactile stimuli were encoded, the blind showed a pronounced occipital and the sighted a pronounced frontal activation. The task-specific amplitude increment of a negative slow wave which can be understood as a manifestation of the process of mental rotation proper, showed a different topography for sighted and for blind subjects too. It had its maximum over central to parietal cortical areas in both groups, but it extended more towards occipital regions in the blind. In both groups, the effects were very similar to those observed in former studies with visual versions of the mental rotation task, i.e. the slow wave amplitude over central to parietal areas increased monotonously with an increasing angular disparity of the two stimuli to be compared. These results are discussed with respect to the question of whether visual deprivation in the blind can cause a reorganization of cortical representational maps.

VIn vitro studies with mammalian cell lines and gum arabic\u2010coated magnetic nanoparticles __ Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized by the chemical co\u2010precipitation method and coated with gum arabic (GA) by physical adsorption and covalent attachment. Cultures of mammalian cell lines (HEK293, CHO and TE671) were grown in the presence of uncoated and GA\u2010coated MNPs. Cellular growth was followed by optical microscopy in order to assess the proportion of cells with particles, alterations in cellular density and the presence of debris. The in vitro assays demonstrated that cells from different origins are affected differently by the presence of the nanoparticles. Also, the methods followed for GA coating of MNPs endow distinct surface characteristics that probably underlie the observed differences when in contact with the cells. In general, the nanoparticles to which the GA was adsorbed had a smaller ability to attach to the cells' surface and to compromise the viability of the cultures.

VStructure of d\u2010alanine\u2010d\u2010alanine ligase from Thermus thermophilus HB8: cumulative conformational change and enzyme\u2013ligand interactions __ d\u2010Alanine\u2010d\u2010alanine ligase (Ddl) is one of the key enzymes in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and is an important target for drug discovery. The enzyme catalyzes the condensation of two d\u2010Ala molecules using ATP to produce d\u2010Ala\u2010d\u2010Ala, which is the terminal peptide of a peptidoglycan monomer. The structures of five forms of the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtDdl) were determined: unliganded TtDdl (2.3\u2005Å resolution), TtDdl\u2013adenylyl imidodiphosphate (2.6\u2005Å), TtDdl\u2013ADP (2.2\u2005Å), TtDdl\u2013ADP\u2013d\u2010Ala (1.9\u2005Å) and TtDdl\u2013ATP\u2013d\u2010Ala\u2010d\u2010Ala (2.3\u2005Å). The central domain rotates as a rigid body towards the active site in a cumulative manner in concert with the local conformational change of three flexible loops depending upon substrate or product binding, resulting in an overall structural change from the open to the closed form through semi\u2010open and semi\u2010closed forms. Reaction\u2010intermediate models were simulated using TtDdl\u2010complex structures and other Ddl structures previously determined by X\u2010ray methods. The catalytic process accompanied by the cumulative conformational change has been elucidated based on the intermediate models in order to provide new insights regarding the details of the catalytic mechanism.

VComputer experience and gender differences in undergraduate mental rotation performance __ Gender differences in mental rotation and computer experiences were investigated. Undergraduates, 27 men and 83 women, completed a brief self-report inventory of computer experiences and were pretested on the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation (VTMR). Students then participated in two 30-min sessions, spaced 1 week apart, in which they played a computer game. One half played a game that required mental rotation of geometric figures (\u2018Blockout\u2019), the other half played a card game that did not involve mental rotation (\u2018Solitaire\u2019). After the second computer game session, students retook the VTMR. A gender difference favoring men over women was obtained on the pretest VTMR. On the posttest VTMR, women in each group and men who played Blockout outperformed men who played Solitaire. Differences in selfreported computer use and efficacy were associated with differences on the VTMR. Success on Blockout was correlated with success on the VTMR. Computer experiences, including game playing, are a factor in VTMR performance differences among undergraduates.

VGlobalized Mergers and Acquisitions The Dangers of a Monoculture __ The agricultural Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s was set in motion to attempt to solve the actual and projected shortfalls of food over the coming decades. Specialized hybrids of basic food crops, such as wheat, corn, and soybeans, could be created for higher yield, resistance to disease, and sustainable growth in various weather conditions and soils. The creation and widespread use of such designer plants were not, however, without its critics. One of the dangers pointed out was that since a single, specialized crop might be susceptible to an asyetunknown disease or blight or change in a weather pattern, a nation's or the world's entire harvest of that crop might be affected. The greater the diversity of seeds and crops, the less likely it would be that the system as a whole would be at risk. In addition, Malthusian forces would be in effect. That is, with more food available, world populations would tend to increase to the limits of available supply in bountiful times. Thus any future lean years would result in a crisis of far greater proportions than that then currently being faced. In general, the issue could be stated in a piece of farmers' folkwisdom Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

VThe development of epilepsy in the paediatric brain __ The immature central nervous system (CNS) is more susceptible to the development of seizures than its adult counterpart. Developmental studies of experimental seizures have suggested that young animals have unique behavioural seizure patterns, including the presence of bilateral, though asymmetric, convulsions. There are differences in the mechanisms responsible for the generation of seizures, propagation patterns and seizure arrest and recurrences. These differences are due to local factors as well as factors that affect neural systems consisting of long neuronal circuits. The substantia nigra, a site involved in the control of seizures, will be used as an example to demonstrate how evolving neurobiological processes modulate the suppression or exacerbation of seizures with age. Evidence will also be presented indicating that early in life, seizures may not produce hippocampal damage. An understanding of the age-related differences is important for the development of rational approaches to treating seizures and their consequences.

VLessons from the eradication campaigns __ Of seven global eradication programs this century, only two have relied primarily on vaccines for control measures \u2014 those against smallpox and poliomyelitis. Smallpox is history and polio could possibly achieve a similar status within the next decade. The hallmarks of these successful programs were surveillance and community outreach and involvement. However, a research agenda, so crucial to smallpox eradication, has largely been ignored or dismissed by polio program managers. This could prove to be a serious, even fatal error.

VAge differences in spatial memory in a virtual environment navigation task __ The use of virtual environment (VE) technology to assess spatial navigation in humans has become increasingly common and provides an opportunity to quantify age-related deficits in human spatial navigation and promote a comparative approach to the neuroscience of cognitive aging. The purpose of the present study was to assess age differences in navigational behavior in a VE and to examine the relationship between this navigational measure and other more traditional measures of cognitive aging. Following pre-training, participants were confronted with a VE spatial learning task and completed a battery of cognitive tests. The VE consisted of a richly textured series of interconnected hallways, some leading to dead ends and others leading to a designated goal location in the environment. Compared to younger participants, older volunteers took longer to solve each trial, traversed a longer distance, and made significantly more spatial memory errors. After 5 learning trials, 86% of young and 24% of elderly volunteers were able to locate the goal without error. Performance on the VE navigation task was positively correlated with measures of mental rotation and verbal and visual memory.

VEffect of spatial attention on mental rotation __ Normal right-handed subjects performed a task requiring mental rotation of the letter R, presented in varying angular orientations in the left or right visual fields. They were told to attend to the side indicated prior to each trial by a certrally located arrow, while maintaining visual fixation on the arrow. On 75% of trials (compatible trials) the arrow pointed to the side of the letter, while on 25% (incompatible trials) it pointed to the other side. Although overall RT was shorter on compatible than on incompatible trials, there was no evidence that spatial attention affected mental-rotation rate. However, estimated rate was higher when attention was to the left side of space, consistent with right hemispheric specialization for mental rotation. This effect was especially marked when presentation of the letter was to the right.

VPrevalence and types of androgenetic alopecia in Shanghai, China: a community\u2010based study __ Background\u2002 There are ethnic differences in the prevalence and types of androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Although there have been several reports on the prevalence and types of AGA in caucasian and Asian populations, there are very few data on a Chinese population that have been derived from a sufficient number of samples. Objectives\u2002 To estimate the prevalence and types of AGA in a Chinese population, and to compare the results with those in caucasians and Koreans reported previously in the literature. Methods\u2002 A population\u2010based cross\u2010sectional study was carried out in 7056 subjects (3519 men and 3537 women) from May 2006 to December 2006 in a community of Shanghai. Questionnaires were completed during face\u2010to\u2010face interviews at the subjects\u2019 homes. The degree of AGA was classified according to the Norwood and Ludwig classifications. Results\u2002 The prevalence of AGA in Chinese men was 19·9%, and the prevalence of female pattern AGA in men was 0·1%. The most common type in men was type III vertex (3·5%). The prevalence of AGA in women was 3·1%, while male pattern AGA was found in those aged over 50\u2003years (0·4%), and the most common type was type I (Ludwig classification) (1·4%). A family history of AGA was present in 55·8% of men and 32·4% of women with AGA. Conclusions\u2002 The prevalence of AGA in Chinese men was lower than in caucasian men but was similar to that in Korean men; however, over the age of 60\u2003years it was approaching that in caucasian men but was higher than that in Korean men. The most common type in Chinese men with AGA was type III vertex. Interestingly, the prevalence of AGA in Chinese women was lower than that in Korean women and caucasian women, and type I was the most common type (Ludwig classification).

VTopographic study of human event-related potentials using a task requiring mental rotation __ Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a mental rotation task that required subjects to determine whether two stimuli presented in turn had the same shape regardless of any difference in orientation. This task consisted of two conditions: the control condition, when the two stimuli presented were identical, requiring only recognition, and the experimental condition that required recognition following mental rotation. We hypothesized that differences between ERPs recorded during the control and experimental conditions were neurophysiologically correlated with mental rotation. In the experimental condition, a marked negative component arose about 430 ms after the second stimulus. The statistically significant difference between the negative components of the two conditions was maximal over the right frontocentral region, suggesting that mental rotation processing is a right hemisphere dominant function.

VOn separating processes of event categorization, task preparation, and mental rotation proper in a handedness recognition task __ We investigated the nature of event\u2010related potential (ERP) effects in a handedness recognition task requiring mental rotation. Thirty subjects were tested with rotated and sometimes reflected alphanumeric characters while ERPs were recorded from 18 electrodes. On each trial, a cue provided valid information about the angular displacement of the following probe. This design allowed a distinction between three processing episodes: evaluation of the difficulty of the forthcoming task, preparation for the task, and the mental rotation task itself. The three episodes were accompanied by distinct ERP effects having distinct polarities, a different rank order of amplitudes for different probe orientations, and a different topography. These data confirm previous findings showing that mental rotation is accompanied by a parietal negativity. However, they also suggest that the rotation\u2010related negativity found after tilted stimuli in standard mental rotation tasks is most likely overlapping with another, simultaneously triggered ERP effect functionally related to an evaluation of task difficulty.

VColorectal Surgery: Short-Term Prophylaxis with Clindamycin Plus Aztreonam or Gentamicin __ A randomized study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of aztreonam plus clindamycin with that of gentamicin plus clindamycin for prophylaxis of infection following colorectal surgery. A total of 138 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized to treatment with clindamycin (600 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or gentamicin (80 mg) 30 minutes before and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. The study included 122 patients (88.4%) with colorectal carcinoma. Samples from the abdominal cavity and from the subcutaneous tissues were taken for bacteriologic study. All samples from the abdominal cavity yielded microorganisms; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated. Wound infections occurred in eight patients (12.1%) in the aztreonam group and in 12 patients (16.7%) in the gentamicin group. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, enterococci, and staphylococci were isolated most frequently from wounds and were often isolated from bacteriologic samples from the abdominal cavity of the same patients. The incidence of septic complications reflected the extent of nutritional and immunologic impairment. No significant differences were found between groups in the rate of urinary tract or lower respiratory tract infections. Aztreonam/clindamycin appears to be a valid alternative to gentamicin/clindamycin for the prophylaxis of infections following colorectal surgery.

VA characterization of the single-photon sensitivity of an electron multiplying charge-coupled device __ We experimentally characterize the performance of the electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera for the detection of single photons. The tests are done with the photon pairs generated from parametric downconversion (PDC). The gain, time response and noise performance of the EMCCD are characterized. In addition, we attempt to use the camera to measure the spatial correlations of PDC. The results reveal the capabilities and limits of the EMCCD as a single-photon-detector array for the applications of quantum optics, astronomy and microscopy.

VMental rotation strategies reflected in event\u2010related (de)synchronization of alpha and mu power __ During a mental rotation task of hands, participants mentally rotate their hand into the orientation of the shown hand. These mental movements are subject to the body's biomechanical constraints. In this study, we investigated whether the involvement of motor processes during the mental rotation process, as reflected in mu\u2010power desynchronization, is also influenced by one's movement capabilities. We performed an EEG study and used a delayed response mental rotation task of hands to examine the event\u2010related desynchronization differences between movements that are biomechanically easy and difficult to perform. Our results show an increase in event\u2010related desynchronization of the mu power for biomechanically easy compared to difficult\u2010to\u2010adopt postures. These findings provide further evidence for the notion that motor simulations can only be performed for movements that can already be performed overtly.

VLimb amputations in fixed dystonia: A form of body integrity identity disorder? __ Fixed dystonia is a disabling disorder mainly affecting young women who develop fixed abnormal limb postures and pain after apparently minor peripheral injury. There is continued debate regarding its pathophysiology and management. We report 5 cases of fixed dystonia in patients who sought amputation of the affected limb. We place these cases in the context of previous reports of patients with healthy limbs and patients with chronic regional pain syndrome who have sought amputation. Our cases, combined with recent data regarding disorders of mental rotation in patients with fixed dystonia, as well as previous data regarding body integrity identity disorder and amputations sought by patients with chronic regional pain syndrome, raise the possibility that patients with fixed dystonia might have a deficit in body schema that predisposes them to developing fixed dystonia and drives some to seek amputation. The outcome of amputation in fixed dystonia is invariably unfavorable. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society

VPMMA particle\u2010mediated DNA vaccine for cervical cancer __ DNA vaccination is a novel immunization strategy that possesses many potential advantages over other vaccine strategies. One of the major difficulties hindering the clinical application of DNA vaccination is the relative poor immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a synthetic polymer approved by the Food and Drug Administration for certain human clinical applications such as the bone cement. In vivo, PMMA particles are phagocytosable and have the potential to initiate strong immune responses by stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we synthesized a series of PMMA particles (PMMA 1\u20135) with different particle sizes and surface charges to test the feasibility of implementing such polymer particles for DNA vaccination. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that the gene gun can deliver DNA vaccine by propelling PMMA particles mixed with plasmid DNA for cervical cancer. It was found that PMMA 4 particles (particle size: 460 ± 160 nm, surface charge: +11.5 ± 1.8 mV) stimulated the highest level of TNF\u2010\u03b1 production by macrophages in vitro and yielded the best result of antitumor protection in vivo. Therefore, our results possess the potential for translation and implementation of polymer particles in gene gun delivering DNA vaccination. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res, 2009

VAssessment of the impact of liquid wastes on benthic invertebrate assemblages __ Modified assemblages corresponding with the zone of dispersion of acid-iron effluents from the manufacture of titanium oxide pigments in a range of marine and freshwater receiving waters have been identified in tropical and temperate climates. The findings of these studies over several years are reviewed using a wide range of examples. The methodology used for the collection and extraction of the macrofauna, small invertebrates and meiofauna is described. Multivariate analytical techniques used to identify and delineate impact zones are illustrated and the high resolution attributed to the detailed examination of the meiofauna. The shape of such impact zones is dependent, among other factors, on the strength and direction of current flow. Although the sediments in the impact zones which we have studied are not abiotic, their assemblages tend to be characterized by a reduced species richness and a corresponding increase in abundance of resistant species. Results from one of these detailed surveys (Calais), over a 5 year period, indicate that the impact zone is remarkably stable and occupies a similar area in successive years. Disposal of these anthropogenic wastes thus appears to modify assemblage structure in a way which is essentially similar to that imposed by natural stress factors.

VReal Options Valuation: A Case Study of an E\u2010commerce Company __ This paper presents a real options valuation model with original solutions to some issues that arise frequently when trying to apply these models to real\u2010life situations. The authors build on existing models by introducing an innovative and intuitive risk neutral adjustment that allows us to work with all the simulated paths. The problem of incorporating real options into each path is solved with a \u201cnearest neighbors\u201d technique, and uncertainty is simulated using a beta distribution that adapts better to company\u2010specific information. The model is then applied to a real life e\u2010commerce company to produce the following insights: the expanded present value is higher than the traditional present value; the presence of several real options make them interact so that their values are nonadditive; and part of the expanded present value is explained by the presence of \u201cJensen's inequality\u201d that stems from the \u201cconvexity\u201d between the value of each year's cash flow and the uncertain variables.

DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue and the highly polymorphic second and third exons of the HLA-A and HLA-B genes were independently PCR amplified using specific primers. Individual allele types were identified using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results showed that the main frequency differences occurred between the late-onset AD and the control group however none of these reached statistical significance.

VThe 2df SDSS LRG and QSO survey: evolution of the luminosity function of luminous red galaxies to z= 0.6 __ We present new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the 2dF SDSS LRG and Quasar (2SLAQ) survey. We have carefully quantified, and corrected for, uncertainties in the K and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colour selection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we are studying the same galaxy population in both surveys. Using a limited subset of 6326 SDSS LRGs (with 0.17 < z < 0.24) and 1725 2SLAQ LRGs (with 0.5 < z < 0.6), for which the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence for any additional evolution in the LRG LF, over this redshift range, beyond that expected from a simple passive evolution model. This lack of additional evolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of SDSS and 2SLAQ LRGs, brighter than M0.2r\u2212 5 log h0.7=\u221222.5, which are 2.51 ± 0.03 × 10\u22127\u2003L\u2299\u2003Mpc\u22123 and 2.44 ± 0.15 × 10\u22127\u2003L\u2299\u2003Mpc\u22123, respectively (<10 per cent uncertainty). We compare our LFs to the COMBO-17 data and find excellent agreement over the same redshift range. Together, these surveys show no evidence for additional evolution (beyond passive) in the LF of LRGs brighter than M0.2r\u2212 5 log h0.7=\u221221 (or brighter than \u223cL*). We test our SDSS and 2SLAQ LFs against a simple \u2018dry merger\u2019 model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at least half of the LRGs at z\u2243 0.2 must already have been well assembled (with more than half their stellar mass) by z\u2243 0.6. This limit is barely consistent with recent results from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.

VCross\u2010modal facilitation of mental rotation: Effects of modality and complexity __ Performance in a visual mental rotation (MR) task has been reported to predict the ability to recognize retrograde\u2010transformed melodies. The current study investigated the effects of melodic structure on the MR of sequentially presented visual patterns. Each trial consisted of a five\u2010segment sequentially presented visual pattern (standard) followed by a five\u2010tone melody that was either identical in structure to the standard or its retrograde. A visual target pattern was either the rotated version of the standard or unrelated to it. The task was to indicate whether the target pattern was a rotated version of the standard or not. Periodic patterns were not rotated but melodies facilitated the rotation of non\u2010periodic patterns. For these, rotation latency was determined by a quantitative index of complexity (number of runs). This study provides the first experimental confirmation for cross\u2010modal facilitation of MR.

VPerformance of a data-parallel concurrent constraint programming system __ Abstract: Finite domain constraints [27] are very effective in solving a class of integer problems which find its applications in various areas like scheduling and operations research. The advantage over conventional approaches is that the problem is specified declaratively. The actual computation is carried out by logic inference and constraint satisfaction [24]. Solving a set of finite domain constraints is an intractable problem and we propose to use massively parallel computers to obtain satisfactory performance. In our previous papers, we have shown that finite domain constraint languages can be implemented on massively parallel SIMD machines. The resulting system, Firebird, has been implemented on a DECmpp 12000 Sx-100 massively parallel computer with 8,192 processor elements. In this paper, some preliminary performance results are given. A speedup of 2 orders of magnitude is possible when we compare the performance using 8,192 processor elements and the performance using a single processor element of the same machine. On the other hand, we measure the effects of several control strategies and optimizations on execution time and memory consumption in a data-parallel context.

VFully embedded high Q circular stacked spiral inductors into organic substrate __ In this paper, fully embedded circular\u2010stacked spiral inductors are investigated into a multilayered PCB substrate for low cost and miniaturized RF system on package (SOP) applications. The embedded circular\u2010stacked inductors are optimally designed to obtain high quality factor and self\u2010resonant frequency by using 3D EM simulator. The fabricated two\u2010turn circular\u2010stacked inductor has an inductance of 8.4 nH and a maximum quality factor of 67 at 1.2 GHz. The device size of the staked inductor is \u223c65% of the planar inductor. The measured performance characteristics are well matched with the 3D EM\u2010simulated ones. The embedded circular stacked spiral inductors are promising for organic\u2010based SOP, which needs various functionality, low cost, small size and volume, and high packaging density. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VRole of cell-surface molecules of Blastomyces dermatitidis in host-pathogen interactions __ The fungal pathogen Blastomyces dermatitidis produces an adhesin (WI-1) in yeast stages, which contains repetitive regions that bind host-cell receptors. Adhesin and glucan may modulate fungal interactions with macrophages; their level of expression is altered in hypovirulent mutants. Adhesin is also involved in immune responses, and may be important in eliciting the clearance of the fungus.

VRelationship of TT virus and Helicobacter pylori infections in gastric tissues of patients with gastritis __ Blood and gastric tissue biopsies of 34 patients with gastritis were tested for the presence of TT virus (TTV), a ubiquitous virus found in the blood of most humans. Thirty\u2010one of these patients were TTV positive, and 27 patients had virus in both tissues. In addition, 13 of the patients who had TTV in gastric tissue were Helicobacter pylori positive. There was an association of higher TTV titers in gastric tissues of patients who were H. pylori positive than in those in whom the bacterium could not be detected. Furthermore, this association was stronger in H. pylori\u2010positive patients with the presence of the cagA protein. Of 10 specimens in which genogroup determination was carried out in the gastric corpus, 5/5 that were H. pylori positive showed the presence of TTV genogroup 3, while for those that were H. pylori negative, 5/5 showed the presence of genogroup 1t. By contrast, genogroup 1 was found in the corpus of only one H. pylori\u2010positive patient, and genogroup 3 in only one H. pylori\u2010negative patient. The histological severity of gastritis did correlate significantly with loads in the gastric tissues. There was no significant difference in TTV titer in blood of patients regardless of H. pylori infection status. These findings pique interest in clarifying the role of TTV, alone or in association with H. pylori infection, in the pathogenesis of gastritis. J. Med.

VCortical Activation during Visual Spatial Processing: Relation between Hemispheric Asymmetry of Blood Flow and Performance __ Regional cerebral blood flow was studied in normal males and females during rest and three spatial tasks: counting of rectangular shapes, mental rotation, and cube analysis. Whereas gender caused no significant differences in performance scores or asymmetries, a highly significant relation was found between performance on the cube analysis task and right > left hemisphere flow asymmetry in the parietotemporooccipital border zone (PTO region) during cube analysis. This indicates that subjects utilizing a right hemisphere strategy when solving certain spatial tasks are superior to subjects with more bilateral involvement.

VPressure and temperature dependence of P- and S-wave velocities, seismic anisotropy and density of sheared rocks from the Sierra Alpujata massif (Ronda peridotites, Southern Spain) __ Seismic wave velocities and densities, and their pressure and temperature dependence, of rock samples recovered from surface exposures at the Sierra Alpujata were determined in order to better understand the petrological controls on velocity and density. The rock samples studied are representative of the major lithologies of the Ronda ultramafic body and its metamorphic aureole. The suite of ultramafic rocks includes dunite, harzburgite and lherzolite exhibiting different degrees of deformation and serpentinization. The rocks representing the metamorphic aureole comprise coarse-grained migmatites to ultramylonitic migmatites, gneisses and eclogites. The experimental data include measurements of elastic wave velocities (VP, VS) and densities at confining pressures up to 600 MPa and temperatures up 600°C (at 600 MPa), the determination of the pressure and temperature derivatives of velocities and densities, and the determination of velocity anisotropy. Average P- and S-wave velocities (at 600 MPa) for rocks of the ultramafic body vary from 6.47 to 8.22 km s\u22121 and 3.27 to 4.75 km s\u22121, respectively, mainly due to different degrees of serpentinization. Maximum VP and VS anisotropy is about 8.0% and 9.5%, respectively, and is primarily related to the preferred orientation of olivine. In rocks of the metamorphic aureole, average P-velocities are in the range 5.61\u20137.23 km s\u22121 and S-velocities vary from 3.48 to 4.04 km s\u22121. P- and S-velocity anisotropy is highest (about 6.4% and 4.6%) in sheared rocks (mylonites) and is mainly due to the preferred orientation of biotite and sillimanite. The geophysical significance of the experimental data is briefly discussed.

VEvolved mechanisms underlying wayfinding __ Based on Silverman and Eals' hunter-gatherer theory of the origin of sex-specific spatial attributes, the present research sought to identify the evolved mechanisms involved in hunting that contribute to the dimorphism. The focus of these studies was the relationship between three-dimensional mental rotations, the spatial test showing the largest and most reliable sex difference favoring males, and wayfinding in the woods. Space constancy was presumed to be the evolved mechanism fundamental to both of these abilities. Measures of wayfinding were derived by leading subjects individually on a circuitous route through a wooded area, during which they were stopped at prescribed places and required to set an arrow pointing in the direction the walk began. As well, subjects were eventually required to lead the experimenters back to the starting point by the most direct route. In support of the hypotheses, males excelled on the various measures of wayfinding, and wayfinding was significantly related across sexes to mental rotations scores but not to nonrotational spatial abilities or general intelligence.

VSpatial Ability, Student Gender, and Academic Performance __ Two groups of engineering students were tested for spatial ability (Mental Rotation Test = MRT). There were sex differences favouring males, similar to those seen in other academic programs. There were no significant sex differences in academic course performance, suggesting that differences in spatial ability as measured by the MRT do not have an impact on course performance. In addition, minimal experience with the mental rotation task produced large gains in performance and reduced the magnitude of sex differences. The results suggest that sweeping statements about the relation between differences in spatial ability and performance in science and mathematics subject areas, especially with reference to females, must be viewed with caution.

VGABAA receptors in auditory brainstem nuclei of the chick during development and after cochlea removal __ The presence of GABAA receptors (GABARs) in auditory brainstem nuclei of the chick was determined by immunocytochemical (ICC) and receptor autoradiographic techniques. A monoclonal antibody to the GABAR/benzodiazepine/chloride channel complex and radiolabeled ligand binding using [3H]-muscimol, a GABA agonist, revealed labeling in nucleus magnocellularis (NM), nucleus laminaris (NL), nucleus angularis (NA), and the superior olive (SO) in both posthatch and embryonic chicks. GABAR-immunoreactivity (GABAR-I), as well as [3H]-muscimol binding, appear homogeneous throughout these nuclei at all ages studied. During development, GABAR-I is first observed in these nuclei around embryonic day 13 (E13). GABAR-I, which appears heavier in embryos than in posthatch chicks, becomes less intense with age in all 4 nuclei.Levels of receptor binding are also greater in embryos compared to posthatch chicks. [3H]-Muscimol binding is consistently greatest in SO followed by that in NL. NM and NA exhibit the least amount of binding at all ages studied. [3H]-Muscimol binding decreases in auditory brainstem nuclei as a function of age.Two days after unilateral cochlea removal, there is an apparent increase in GABAR-I in the ipsilateral NM compared to controls. This, however, may be the result of a decrease in the cross-sectional area of NM neurons as a result of de-afferentation (Born and Rubel, 1985). In contrast, there is a 28% decrease in [3H]-muscimol binding in the ipsilateral NM compared to controls probably reflecting the 30% reduction in the number of NM neurons due to cochlea removal (Born and Rubel, 1985). Fourteen days after cochlea removal, there is still a small, but not significant, decrease in [3H]-muscimol binding in the ipsilateral NM. In the contralateral NM, GABAR-I is less intense compared to that in the ipsilateral NM and controls. Additionally, there is a slight but insignificant decrease in [3H]-muscimol binding compared to that in controls 2 days after cochlea removal. After 14 days survival, however, the average binding is similar to that in controls. Thus, cochlea removal appears to transiently decrease the number of GABARs in the ipsilateral NM and may have a similar, but not as dramatic, effect in the contralateral NM. These GABARs are most likely to be postsynaptic, that is, located on NM neurons.

VDelayed platelet engraftment in group O patients after autologous progenitor cell transplantation __ BACKGROUND: Fucosylated glycans, including H\u2010antigen, play critical roles in hematopoietic progenitor cell homing, adhesion, growth, and differentiation. H\u2010active antigens are strongly expressed on CD34+ progenitor cells and committed megakaryocytic progenitors and may mediate adhesion to marrow stromal fibroblasts. We examined the possible influence of donor ABO type on platelet (PLT) engraftment after autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant (PBPCT). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent a single autologous PBPCT between 1996 and 2000 were reviewed. Neutrophil and PLT engraftment were compared by patient ABO type and CD34+ cell dose by t test, chi\u2010square test, analysis of variance, Kaplan\u2010Meier probability, and log\u2010rank test. RESULTS: Engraftment data was available in 195 patients. PLT engraftment was delayed in all patients, regardless of ABO type, at CD34+ PBPC doses of 2\u2003×\u2003106 to 3\u2003×\u2003106 per kg (p\u2003<\u20030.001). When examined by ABO type, late PLT engraftment (PLT count >\u200a50\u2003×\u2003109/L) was significantly delayed in group\u2003O patients relative to all non\u2010group\u2003O patients (32.4\u2003days vs. 19.6 days, p\u2003<\u20030.001). Approximately 50\u2003percent of group\u2003O patients required more than 40\u2003days to achieve late PLT recovery (p\u2003<\u20030.005). CONCLUSIONS: A group\u2003O phenotype may be associated with delayed PLT engraftment at lower CD34 doses.

VHow Important Is the Digital Divide? The Relation of Computer and Videogame Usage to Gender Differences in Mental Rotation Ability __ Researchers interested in the associations of gender with spatial experience and spatial ability have not yet focused on several activities that have become common in the modern digitalage. In this study, using a new questionnaire called the Survey of Spatial Representation and Activities (SSRA), we examined spatial experiences with computers and videogames in a sample of nearly 1,300 undergraduate students. Large gender differences, which favored men, were found in computer experience. Although men and women also differed on SAT scores, gender differences in computer experience were still apparent with SAT factored out. Furthermore, men and women with high and low levels of computer experience, who were selected for more intensive study, were found to differ significantly on the Mental Rotations Test (MRT). Path analyses showed that computer experience substantially mediates the gender difference in spatial ability observed on the MRT. These results collectively suggest that the \u201cDigital Divide\u201d is an important phenomenon and that encouraging women and girls to gain spatial experiences, such as computer usage, might help to bridge the gap in spatial ability between the sexes.

VThe link between mental rotation ability and basic numerical representations __ Mental rotation and number representation have both been studied widely, but although mental rotation has been linked to higher-level mathematical skills, to date it has not been shown whether mental rotation ability is linked to the most basic mental representation and processing of numbers. To investigate the possible connection between mental rotation abilities and numerical representation, 43 participants completed four tasks: 1) a standard pen-and-paper mental rotation task; 2) a multi-digit number magnitude comparison task assessing the compatibility effect, which indicates separate processing of decade and unit digits; 3) a number-line mapping task, which measures precision of number magnitude representation; and 4) a random number  generation task, which yields measures both of executive control and of spatial number representations. Results show that mental rotation ability correlated significantly with both size of the compatibility effect and with number mapping accuracy, but not with any measures from the random number generation task. Together, these results suggest that higher mental rotation abilities are linked to more developed number representation, and also provide further evidence for the connection between spatial and numerical abilities.

VPerformance on Middle School Geometry Problems With Geometry Clues Matched to Three Different Cognitive Styles __ ABSTRACT\u2014 This study investigated the relationship between 3 ability\u2010based cognitive styles (verbal deductive, spatial imagery, and object imagery) and performance on geometry problems that provided different types of clues. The purpose was to determine whether students with a specific cognitive style outperformed other students, when the geometry problems provided clues compatible with their cognitive style. Students were identified as having a particular cognitive style when they scored equal to or above the median on the measure assessing this ability. A geometry test was developed in which each problem could be solved on the basis of verbal reasoning clues (matching verbal deductive cognitive style), mental rotation clues (matching spatial imagery cognitive style), or shape memory clues (matching object imagery cognitive style). Straightforward cognitive style\u2013clue\u2010compatibility relationships were not supported. Instead, for the geometry problems with either mental rotation or shape memory clues, students with a combination of both verbal and spatial cognitive styles tended to do the best. For the problems with verbal reasoning clues, students with either a verbal or a spatial cognitive style did well, with each cognitive style contributing separately to success. Thus, both spatial imagery and verbal deductive cognitive styles were important for solving geometry problems, whereas object imagery was not. For girls, a spatial imagery cognitive style was advantageous for geometry problem solving, regardless of type of clues provided.

VVideo Games and Spatial Cognition __ Video game enthusiasts spend many hours at play, and this intense activity has the potential to alter both brain and behavior. We review studies that investigate the ability of video games to modify processes in spatial cognition. We outline the initial stages of research into the underlying mechanisms of learning, and we also consider possible applications of this new knowledge. Several experiments have shown that playing action games induces changes in a number of sensory, perceptual, and attentional abilities that are important for many tasks in spatial cognition. These basic capacities include contrast sensitivity, spatial resolution, the attentional visual field, enumeration, multiple object tracking, and visuomotor coordination and speed. In addition to altering performance on basic tasks, playing action video games has a beneficial effect on more complex spatial tasks such as mental rotation, thus demonstrating that learning generalizes far beyond the training activities in the game. Far transfer of this sort is generally elusive in learning, and we discuss some early attempts to elucidate the brain functions that are responsible. Finally, we suggest that studying video games may contribute not only to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of learning but may also offer new approaches to teaching spatial skills.

VSelective effects of motor expertise in mental body rotation tasks: Comparing object-based and perspective transformations __ Brain imaging studies provide strong evidence for the involvement of the human mirror system during the observation of complex movements, depending on the individual\u2019s motor expertise. Here, we ask the question whether motor expertise not only affects perception while observing movements, but also benefits perception while solving mental rotation tasks. Specifically, motor expertise should only influence the performance in mental body rotation tasks (MBRT) with left\u2013right judgment, evoking a perspective transformation, whereas motor expertise should not affect the MBRT with same-different judgment, evoking an object-related transformation. Participants with and without motor expertise for rotational movements were tested in these two conditions in the MBRT. Results showed that motor experience selectively affected performance in the MBRT with the left\u2013right judgment, but not with same-different judgment. More precisely, motor expertise only benefited performance when human figures were presented in (for non-experts) unfamiliar, upside-down body orientations.

VMental Rotation: Cross-Task Training and Generalization __ It is well established that performance on standard mental rotation tasks improves with training (Peters et al., 1995), but thus far there is little consensus regarding the degree of transfer to other tasks which also involve mental rotation. In Experiment 1, we assessed the effect of mental rotation training on participants\u2019 Mental Rotation Test (MRT) scores. Twenty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a \u201cOne-Day Training,\u201d \u201cSpaced Training,\u201d or \u201cNo Training\u201d group. Participants who received training achieved higher scores on the MRT, an advantage that was still evident after 1 week. Distribution of training did not affect performance. Experiment 2 assessed generalization of mental rotation training to a more complex mental rotation task, laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgical skills were assessed using Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) tasks. Thirty-four participants were randomly assigned to a \u201cFull Mental Rotation Training, MRT and FLS,\u201d \u201cMRT and FLS,\u201d or \u201cFLS-only\u201d group. MRT results from Experiment 1 were replicated and mental rotation training was found to elicit higher scores on the MRT. Further, mental rotation training was found to generalize to certain laparoscopic surgical tasks. Participants who obtained mental rotation training performed significantly better on mental-rotation dependent surgical tasks than participants who did not receive training. Therefore, surgical training programs can use simple computer or paper-based mental rotation training instead of more expensive materials to enhance certain aspects of surgical performance of trainees.

VEffect of degree and direction of rotation in egocentric mental rotation of hand: an event-related potential study __ We explored the neural mechanisms of mental rotation of hand, which may invoke a mental transformation of viewer\u2019s own hands. It was found that, when a hand picture was presented at an orientation rotated from the upright orientation, participants\u2019 performance in making left or right hand judgment was affected by the degree and direction of rotation, with the direction effect being implicated as the evidence for egocentric mental rotation. Our event-related potentials measure supported the idea that amplitude modulation in the parietal cortex is a psychophysiological marker of the mental rotation of hand. Furthermore, the rotation-direction-dependent modulation of a positive wave was identified as possible neural correlate for the egocentric nature of such mental rotation.

VMental Rotation and Orientation-Dependence in Shape Recognition __ How do we recognize objects despite differences in their retinal projections when they are seen at different orientations? Marr and Nishihara (1978) proposed that shapes are represented in memory as structural descriptions in object-centered coordinate systems, so that an object is represented identically regardless of its orientation. An alternative hypothesis is that an object is represented in memory in a single representation corresponding to a canonical orientation, and a mental rotation operation transforms an input shape into that orientation before input and memory are compared. A third possibility is that shapes are stored in a set of representations, each corresponding to a different orientation. In four experiments, subjects studied several objects each at a single orientation, and were given extensive practice at naming them quickly, or at classifying them as normal or mirror-reversed, at several orientations. At first, response times increased with departure from the study orientation, with a slope similar to those obtained in classic mental rotation experiments. This suggests that subjects made both judgments by mentally transforming the orientation of the input shape to the one they had initially studied. With practice, subjects recognized the objects almost equally quickly at all the familiar orientations. At that point they were probed with the same objects appearing at novel orientations. Response times for these probes increased with increasing disparity from the previously trained orientations. This indicates that subjects had stored representations of the shapes at each of the practice orientations and recognized shapes at the new orientations by rotating them to one of the stored orientations. The results are consistent with a hybrid of the second (mental transformation) and third (multiple view) hypotheses of shape recognition: input shapes are transformed to a stored view, either the one at the nearest orientation or one at a canonical orientation. Interestingly, when mirror-images of trained shapes were presented for naming, subjects took the same time at all orientations. This suggests that mental transformations of orientation can take the shortest path of rotation that will align an input shape and its memorized counterpart, in this case a rotation in depth about an axis in the picture plane.

VWhen does Human Object Recognition use a Viewer-Centered Reference Frame? __ How do people recognize an object in different orientations? One theory is that the visual system describes the object relative to a reference frame centered on the object, resulting in a representation that is invariant across orientations. Chronometric data show that this is true only when an object can be identified uniquely by the arrangement of its parts along a single dimension. When an object can only be distinguished by an arrangement of its parts along more than one dimension, people mentally rotate it to a familiar orientation. This finding suggests that the human visual reference frame is tied to egocentric coordinates.

VDurable and Generalized Effects of Spatial Experience on Mental Rotation: Gender Differences in Growth Patterns __ This study addressed questions about improvement in mental rotation skills: (1) whether growth trajectories differ for men and women with higher or lower spatial experience, (2) whether videogame training has effects on performance and leads to transfer, (3) whether effects of repeated testing or training effects are durable and (4) whether transfer is durable. Undergraduates participated in repeated testing on the MRT or played the videogame Tetris. Analyses showed large improvements in mental rotation with both repeated testing and training; these gains were maintained several months later. MRT scores of men and women did not converge, but men showed faster initial growth and women showed more improvement later. Videogame training showed greater initial growth than repeated testing alone, but final performance did not differ. Effects of videogame training transferred to other spatial tasks exceeding the effects of repeated testing, and this transfer advantage was still evident after several months.

VAre traditional cognitive tests useful in predicting clinical success? __ The purpose of this research was to determine the predictive value of the Dental Admission Test (DAT) for clinical success using Ackerman's theory of ability determinants of skilled performance. The Ackerman theory is a valid, reliable schema in the applied psychology literature used to predict complex skill acquisition. Inconsistent stimulus-response skill acquisition depends primarily on determinants of cognitive ability. Consistent information-processing tasks have been described as "automatic," in which stimuli and responses are mapped in a manner that allows for complete certainty once the relationships have been learned. It is theorized that the skills necessary for success in the clinical component of dental schools involve a significant amount of automatic processing demands and, as such, student performance in the clinics should begin to converge as task practice is realized and tasks become more consistent. Subtest scores of the DAT of four classes were correlated with final grades in nine clinical courses. Results showed that the DAT subtest scores played virtually no role with regard to the final clinical grades. Based on this information, the DAT scores were determined to be of no predictive value in clinical achievement.

VIndividual differences in mental rotation: what does gesture tell us? __ Gestures are common when people convey spatial information, for example, when they give directions or describe motion in space. Here, we examine the gestures speakers produce when they explain how they solved mental rotation problems (Shepard and Meltzer in Science 171:701\u2013703, 1971). We asked whether speakers gesture differently while describing their problems as a function of their spatial abilities. We found that low-spatial individuals (as assessed by a standard paper-and-pencil measure) gestured more to explain their solutions than high-spatial individuals. While this finding may seem surprising, finer-grained analyses showed that low-spatial participants used gestures more often than high-spatial participants to convey \u201cstatic only\u201d information but less often than high-spatial participants to convey dynamic information. Furthermore, the groups differed in the types of gestures used to convey static information: high-spatial individuals were more likely than low-spatial individuals to use gestures that captured the internal structure of the block forms. Our gesture findings thus suggest that encoding block structure may be as important as rotating the blocks in mental spatial transformation.

VEffects of the axis of rotation and primordially solicited limb of high level athletes in a mental rotation task __ A recent set of studies has investigated the selective effects of particular physical activities that require full-body rotations, such as gymnastics and wrestling (Moreau, Clerc, Mansy-Dannay, & Guerrien, 2012; Steggemann, Engbert, & Weigelt, 2011), and demonstrated that practicing these activities imparts a clear advantage in in-plane body rotation performance. Other athletes, such as handball and soccer players, whose activities do require body rotations may have more experience with in-depth rotations. The present study examined the effect of two components that are differently solicited in sport practices on the mental rotation ability: the rotation axis (in-plane, in-depth) and the predominantly used limb (arms, legs). Handball players, soccer players, and gymnasts were asked to rotate handball and soccer strike images mentally, which were presented in different in-plane and in-depth orientations. The results revealed that handball and soccer players performed the in-depth rotations faster than in-plane rotations; however, the two rotation axes did not differ in gymnasts. In addition, soccer players performed the mental rotations of handball strike images slower. Our findings suggest that the development of mental rotation tasks that involve the major components of a physical activity allows and is necessary for specifying the links between this activity and the mental rotation performance.

VRelationship Between Spatial Abilities, Mental Rotation and Functional Anatomy Learning __ This study investigated the relationship between visuo-spatial representation, mental rotation (MR) and functional anatomy examination results. A total of 184 students completed the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and Gordon Test of Visual Imagery Control. The time spent on personal assignment was also considered. Men were found to score better than women on both GEFT and MRT, but the gender effect was limited to the interaction with MRT ability in the anatomy learning process. Significant correlations were found between visuo-spatial, MR abilities, and anatomy examination results. Data resulting from the best students\u2019 analyzes underscore the effect of high MR ability which may be considered reliable predictor of success in learning anatomy. The use of specific tests during learning sessions may facilitate the acquisition of anatomical knowledge.

VParietal Lobe Contribution to Mental Rotation Demonstrated with rTMS __ A large number of imaging studies have identified a role for the posterior parietal lobe, in particular Brodmann's area 7 and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in mental rotation. Here we investigated whether neural activity in the posterior parietal lobe is essential for successful mental rotation performance by observing the effects of interrupting this activity during the execution of a mental rotation task. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied to posterior parietal locations estimated to overlie Brodmann's area 7 in the right and the left hemisphere, or to a posterior midline location (sham condition). In three separate experiments, rTMS (four pulses, 20 Hz) was delivered at these locations either 200\u2013400, 400\u2013600, or 600\u2013800 msec after the onset of a mental rotation trial. Disrupting neural activity in the right parietal lobe interfered with task performance, but only when rTMS was delivered 400 to 600 msec after stimulus onset. Stimulation of the left parietal lobe did not reliably affect mental rotation performance at any of the time points investigated. The time-limited effect of rTMS was replicated in a fourth experiment that directly compared the effects of rTMS applied to the right parietal lobe either 200\u2013400 or 400\u2013600 msec into the mental rotation trial. The results indicate that the right superior posterior parietal lobe plays an essential role in mental rotation, consistent with its involvement in a variety of visuospatial and visuomotor transformations.

VMental-rotation deficits following damage to the right basal ganglia __ The authors report the case of a woman with a right basal ganglia lesion and severe mental-rotation impairments. She had no difficulty recognizing rotated objects and had intact left-right orientation in egocentric space but was unable to map the left and right sides of external objects to her egocentric reference frame. This study indicates that the right basal ganglia may be critical components in a cortico-subcortical network involved in mental rotation. We speculate that the role of these structures is to select and maintain an appropriate motor program for performing smooth and accurate rotation. The results also have important implications for theories of object recognition by demonstrating that recognition of rotated objects can be achieved without mental rotation.

VHow spatial abilities enhance, and are enhanced by, dental education __ In two studies with a total of 324 participants, dentistry students were assessed on psychometric measures of spatial ability, reasoning ability, and on new measures of the ability to infer the appearance of a cross-section of a three-dimensional (3-D) object. We examined how these abilities and skills predict success in dental education programs, and whether dental education enhances an individual's spatial competence. The cross-section tests were correlated with spatial ability measures, even after controlling for reasoning ability, suggesting that they rely specifically on the ability to store and transform spatial representations. Sex differences in these measures indicated a male advantage, as is often found on measures of spatial ability. Spatial ability was somewhat predictive of performance in restorative dentistry practical laboratory classes, but not of learning anatomy in general. Comparisons of the performance of students early and late in their dental education indicated that dentistry students develop spatial mental models of the 3-D structure of teeth, which improves their ability to mentally maintain and manipulate representations of these specific structures, but there is no evidence that dental education improves spatial transformation abilities more generally.

VMental Rotation With Tangible Three-Dimensional Objects: A New Measure Sensitive to Developmental Differences in 4- to 8-Year-Old Children __ There is an emerging consensus that spatial thinking is fundamental to later success in math and science. The goals of this study were to design and evaluate a novel test of three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation for 4- to 8-year-old children (N\u2009=\u2009165) that uses tangible 3D objects. Results revealed that the measure was both valid and reliable and indicated steady growth in 3D mental rotation between the ages of 4 and 8. Performance on the measure was highly related to success on a measure of two-dimensional (2D) mental rotation, even after controlling for executive functioning. Although children as young as 5\u2009years old performed above chance, 3D mental rotation appears to be a difficult skill for most children under the age of 7, as indicated by frequent guessing and difficulty with mirror objects. The test is a useful new tool for studying the development of 3D mental rotation in young children.

VThe Role of Spatial Thinking in Undergraduate Science Education __ Spatial thinking is central to many scientific domains and professions spatial ability predicts success and participation in science. However spatial thinking is not is not emphasized in our educational system. This paper presents a selective review of four types of studies regarding spatial thinking in undergraduate science curricula; (1) correlational studies examining the relations between measures of spatial ability and performance in science disciplines, (2) studies that attempt to train aspects of spatial thinking, (3) studies of how students understand specific spatial representations in sciences (4) studies that use dynamic spatial representations to promote scientific understanding. For each type of study, the evidence is critically evaluated and conclusions are drawn about how to nurture spatial thinking in science.

VTypes of visual-spatial representations and mathematical problem solving __ Although visual-spatial representations are used extensively in mathematics and spatial ability is highly correlated with success in mathematics education, research to date has not demonstrated a clear relationship between use of visual-spatial representations and success in mathematical problem solving. The authors distinguished 2 types of visual-spatial representations: schematic representations that encode the spatial relations described in a problem and pictorial representations that encode the visual appearance of the objects described in the problem. Participants solved mathematical problems and reported on their solution strategies. The authors were able to reliably classify their visual-spatial representations as primarily schematic or primarily pictorial. Use of schematic spatial representations was associated with success in mathematical problem solving, whereas use of pictorial representations was negatively correlated with success. Use of schematic representations was also significantly correlated with one measure of spatial ability. The research therefore helps clarify the relationship between visual imagery, spatial ability, and mathematical problem solving. Visual imagery refers to the ability to form mental representations of the appearance of objects and to manipulate.

VCDK4, a Possible Critical Regulator of Apoptosis in Rat Pheochromocytoma PC12 Cells __ The function of cell cycle regulator molecules during apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal was examined in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. When human cDNAs encoding cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, and cell-division cycle 2 (CDC2), were introduced, only CDK4-overexpressing cells were more prone to apoptosis compared with parental cells. In the parental cells, serum withdrawal resulted in the upregulation of CDK4 protein expression 6.6-fold for the first 12 h after serum withdrawal. In contrast, CDK4 protein levels in CDK4-overexpressing cells remained constant for the first 12 h followed by a gradual decline. Expression of cyclin D1 was upregulated in both cell lines. The change in CDK4 kinase activity almost paralleled that of CDK4 protein expression. These results suggest that CDK4 kinase activity is one of the critical regulators in the apoptotic cascade in PC12 cells.

VGravimetric biosensors based on acoustic waves in thin polymer films __ Most gravimetric biosensors use thin piezoelectric quartz crystals, either as resonating crystals (quartz crystal microbalance, QCM), or as bulk/surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. In the majority of these the mass response is inversely proportional to the crystal thickness which, at a limit of about 150 microns, gives inadequate sensitivity. A new system is described in which acoustic waves are launched in very thin (10 microns) tensioned polymer films to produce an oscillatory device. A theoretical equation for this system is almost identical to the well-known Sauerbrey equation used in the QCM method. Because the polymer films are so thin, a 30-fold increase in sensitivity is predicted and verified by adding known surface masses. Temperature sensitivity is a problem so a separate control sensor and careful temperature regulation are necessary. Preliminary results showing the real time binding of protein (IgG), a step towards immunosensor development, and the use of mass enhancing particles are presented. Inexpensive materials are used so disposable gravimetric biosensors may become feasible.

VCanonical views in object representation and recognition __ Human performance in the recognition of 3-D objects, as measured by response times and error rates, frequently depends on the orientation of the object with respect to the observer. We investigated the dependence of response time (RT) and error rate (ER) on stimulus orientation for a class of random wire-like objects. First, we found no evidence for universally valid canonical views: the best view according to one subject's data was often hardly recognized by other subjects. Second, a subject by subject analysis showed that the RT/ER scores were not linearly dependent on the shortest angular distance in 3D to the best view, as predicted by the mental rotation theories of recognition. Rather, the performance was significantly correlated with an image-plane feature by feature deformation distance between the presented view and the best (shortest-RT and lowest-ER) view. Our results suggest that measurement of image-plane similarity to a few (subject-specific) feature patterns is a better model than mental rotation for the mechanism used by the human visual system to recognize objects across changes in their 3-D orientation.

VEffect of inversion on memory for faces in Parkinson's disease and right-hemisphere stroke patients __ Upright and upside-down photographs of faces, schematic drawings of faces, and photographs of houses were presented to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), patients with right hemisphere stroke (RH), and age-matched normal control subjects (NC) in a forced- choice recognition paradigm. These slides were presented in four orientation conditions: upright at original presentation and at test, upside-down at both, upright initially and upside- down at test, and vice versa. NC subjects recognized faces most accurately when presented in the same orientation both times. This suggests that the information is resistant to mental rotation. Patients with PD recognized faces most accurately when they were presented upright both times, suggesting difficulty with any unusual orientation, consistent with an inability to shift mental set. RH patients, unlike the other groups, did not recognize faces presented upright both times more accurately than those in any other condirion. This supports previous studies suggesting a right hemisphere specialization for recognition of upright faces.

VEnhanced hippocampal long\u2010term potentiation and learning by increased neuronal expression of tissue\u2010type plasminogen activator in transgenic mice __ Adult cortical neurons can produce tissue\u2010type plasminogen activator (tPA), an extracellular protease that plays a critical role in fibrinolysis and tissue remodelling processes. There is growing evidence that extracellular proteolysis may be involved in synaptic plasticity, axonal remodelling and neurotoxicity in the adult central nervous system. Here we show that transgenic mice overexpressing tPA in post\u2010natal neurons have increased and prolonged hippocampal long\u2010term potentiation (LTP), and improved performance in spatial orientation learning tasks. Extracellular proteolysis catalysed by tPA may facilitate synaptic micro\u2010remodelling, and thereby play a role in activity\u2010dependent neuronal plasticity and learning.

VClinical and High-resolution Computed Tomographic Findings in Five Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Who Developed Respiratory Failure Following Chemotherapy __ AIM: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who developed respiratory failure after starting chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical records, chest radiographs, and HRCT findings in five patients with non-miliary pulmonary tuberculosis who developed respiratory failure after starting chemotherapy were reviewed. RESULTS: Chest radiographs taken early in the course of acute respiratory failure showed progression of the original lesions with (n=4) or without (n=1) new areas of opacity away from the site of the original lesions. HRCT demonstrated widespread ground-glass attenuation with a reticular pattern as well as segmental or lobar consolidation with cavitation and nodules, consistent with active tuberculous foci in all five cases. Prominent interlobular septal thickening was seen in two cases. Four of the five patients had received corticosteroids. Of these five, two died and three recovered with continued corticosteroid therapy. Transbronchial biopsy in three cases showed evidence of acute alveolar damage. CONCLUSION: In selected patients with tuberculosis who develop respiratory failure following the initiation of antituberculous therapy, HRCT may be a helpful adjunct to clinical evaluation in differentiating hypersensitivity reactions (presumed to be due to the release of mycobacterial antigens) from other pulmonary complications.

VImpact of early diagenesis and bulk particle grain size distribution on estimates of relative geomagnetic palaeointensity variations in sediments from Lama Lake, northern Central Siberia __ High\u2010resolution analyses of rock magnetic and sedimentological parameters were conducted on an 11\u2003m long sediment core from Lama Lake, Northern Siberia, which encompasses the late Pleistocene and the Holocene epochs. The results reveal a strong link between the median grain size of the magnetic particles, identified as magnetite, and the oxidation state of the sediment. Reducing conditions associated with a relative high total organic carbon (TOC) content of the sediment characterize the upper 7\u2003m of the core (\u2248\u2003Holocene), and these have led to a partial dissolution of detrital magnetite grains, and a homogenization of grain\u2010size\u2010related rock magnetic parameters. The anoxic sediments are characterized by significantly larger median magnetic grain sizes, as indicated, for example, by lower median destructive fields of the natural remanent magnetization (MDFNRM) and lower ratios of saturation remanence to saturation magnetization (MSR/MS). Consequently, estimates of relative geomagnetic palaeointensity variations yielded large amplitude shifts associated with anoxic/oxic boundaries. Despite the partial reductive dissolution of magnetic particles within the anoxic section, and consequent minimal variations in magnetic concentration and grain size, palaeointensity estimates for this part of the core were still lithologically distorted by the effects of particle size (and subsidiary TOC) variations. Anomalously high values coincide with an interval of significantly more fine\u2010grained sediment, which is also associated with a decrease in TOC content, which may thus imply a decreased level of magnetite dissolution in this interval. Calculation of relative palaeointensity estimates therefore seems to be compromised by a combined effect of shifts in the particle size distribution of the bulk sediment and by partial magnetite dissolution varying in association with the TOC content of the sediment.

VComputing the Algebraic Immunity Efficiently __ Abstract: The purpose of algebraic attacks on stream and block ciphers is to recover the secret key by solving an overdefined system of multivariate algebraic equations. They become very efficient if this system is of low degree. In particular, they have been used to break stream ciphers immune to all previously known attacks. This kind of attack tends to work when certain Boolean functions used in the ciphering process have either low degree annihilators or low degree multiples. It is therefore important to be able to check this criterion for Boolean functions. We provide in this article an algorithm of complexity $O \u005cleft( m^d\u005cright)$ (for fixed d) which is able to prove that a given Boolean function in m variables has no annihilator nor multiple of degree less than or equal to d. This complexity is essentially optimal. We also provide a more practical algorithm for the same task, which we believe to have the same complexity. This last algorithm is also able to output a basis of annihilators or multiples when they exist.

VChildren's performance in mental rotation tasks: orientation\u2010free features flatten the slope __ Studies of the development of mental rotation have yielded conflicting results, apparently because different mental rotation tasks draw on different cognitive abilities. Children may compare two stimuli at different orientations without mental rotation if the stimuli contain orientation\u2010free features. Two groups of children (78 6\u2010year\u2010olds and 92 8\u2010year\u2010olds) participated in an experiment investigating development of the ability to mentally rotate and the ability to recognize and use orientation\u2010free features. Children compared two stimuli, one upright and one rotated, and responded as quickly as possible indicating whether the stimuli were the same or different. The stimuli were either two panda bears or two ice\u2010cream cones with three scoops of ice\u2010cream of different colors. The panda bears were either identical or mirror images. The cones were either identical, mirror images, or non\u2010mirror images. Response times increased linearly as a function of the angle of orientation when stimuli were the same and when the stimuli were mirror images. But response times were much less dependent on angle of orientation for non\u2010mirror image stimuli. Children as young as 6 years recognized orientation\u2010free stimulus features and responded without mentally rotating when the task permitted this strategy.

VVicinal Fluorine\u2013Proton Coupling Constants __ The angular dependence and the effect of individual substituents upon the NMR vicinal fluorine\u2013proton couplings3JFHhave been studied using data sets of experimental and calculated couplings. Coupling constants for a series of fluoroethane derivatives, CHXF\u2013CH3and CH2F\u2013CH2X(X= CH3, NH2, OH, and F), were calculated by means of the SCFab initioand semiempirical INDO/FPT methods. The calculated couplings reproduce correctly the main experimental trends in spite of the limitation in the calculation because of lack of electronic correlation and the use of medium size basis set. The individual substituent effects \u0394KXiniare described by quadratic expressions on the relative electronegativities of substituents \u0394\u03c7Xi(\u0394KXini=k0ni+kni\u0394\u03c7Xi+ knii\u0394\u03c72Xi). A selected data set of 58 experimental couplings, ranging from 1.9 to 44.4 Hz, has been collected from the literature. An extended Karplus equation with 16 coefficients that includes the electronegativity substituent effects has been derived from the experimental data set with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.2 Hz.

VIdentification of a defensin from the hemolymph of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis __ Hemolymph from partially fed virgin Dermacentor variabilis females was collected following Borrelia burgdorferi challenge and assayed for antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis and B. burgdorferi. A small inducible cationic peptide was identified by SDS-PAGE in the hemolymph of these ticks as early as 1h post challenge. Following purification by a three-step procedure involving sequential SepPak elution, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and gel electrophoresis, the yield of the active peptide was approximately 0.1% of the total protein in the hemolymph plasma. The molecular weight, 4.2kDa, was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. N-terminal sequencing by the Edman degradation method gave a sequence for the first 30 amino acids as: G-F-G-C-P-L-N-Q-G-A-C-H-N-H-C-R-S-I-(R)-(R)-(R)-G-G-Y-C-S-Q-I-I-K. A computer search of databases showed that the peptide had 83% similarity to a defensin found in a scorpion. This is the first report of a defensin from a tick. The peptide was stable at least up to 70°C. Although the tick defensin alone was not immediately effective against B. burgdorferi, tick defensin plus lysozyme killed more than 65% of cultured B. burgdorferi within 1h.

VQuantitative lung perfusion mapping at 0.2 T using FAIR True\u2010FISP MRI __ Perfusion measurements in lung tissue using arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques are hampered by strong microscopic field gradients induced by susceptibility differences between the alveolar air and the lung parenchyma. A true fast imaging with steady precession (True\u2010FISP) sequence was adapted for applications in flow\u2010sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) lung perfusion imaging at 0.2 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla. Conditions of microscopic static field distribution were assessed in four healthy volunteers at both field strengths using multiecho gradient\u2010echo sequences. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the frequency distribution for 180\u2013277 Hz at 1.5 Tesla were more than threefold higher compared to 39\u2013109 Hz at 0.2 Tesla. The influence of microscopic field inhomogeneities on the True\u2010FISP signal yield was simulated numerically. Conditions allowed for the development of a FAIR True\u2010FISP sequence for lung perfusion measurement at 0.2 Tesla, whereas at 1.5 Tesla microscopic field inhomogeneities appeared too distinct. Perfusion measurements of lung tissue were performed on eight healthy volunteers and two patients at 0.2 Tesla using the optimized FAIR True\u2010FISP sequence. The average perfusion rates in peripheral lung regions in transverse, sagittal, and coronal slices of the left/right lung were 418/400, 398/416, and 370/368 ml/100 g/min, respectively. This work suggests that FAIR True\u2010FISP sequences can be considered appropriate for noninvasive lung perfusion examinations at low field strength.

VEnvironmental, scanning electron and optical microscope image analysis software for determining volume and occupied area of solid\u2010state fermentation fungal cultures __ Here we propose a software for the estimation of the occupied area and volume of fungal cultures. This software was developed using a Matlab platform and allows analysis of high\u2010definition images from optical, electronic or atomic force microscopes. In a first step, a single hypha grown on potato dextrose agar was monitored using optical microscopy to estimate the change in occupied area and volume. Weight measurements were carried out to compare them with the estimated volume, revealing a slight difference of less than 1.5%. Similarly, samples from two different solid\u2010state fermentation cultures were analyzed using images from a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an environmental SEM (ESEM). Occupied area and volume were calculated for both samples, and the results obtained were correlated with the dry weight of the cultures. The difference between the estimated volume ratio and the dry weight ratio of the two cultures showed a difference of 10%. Therefore, this software is a promising non\u2010invasive technique to determine fungal biomass in solid\u2010state cultures.

VTwo weeks of transdermal estradiol treatment in postmenopausal elderly women and its effect on memory and mood: verbal memory changes are associated with the treatment induced estradiol levels __ The present randomized double blind study investigated the effects of a 2 week transdermal estradiol treatment on memory performance in 38 healthy elderly women. Cognitive performance was tested at baseline and after 2 weeks of estradiol or placebo treatment using verbal, semantic, and spatial memory tests as well as a mental rotation task and the Stroop. Initial results showed no differences after treatment between placebo or estradiol treated subjects. However, within treatment group analysis revealed that estradiol treated subjects who reached higher estradiol levels (larger than 29 pg/ml) performed significantly better after treatment in the delayed recall of the paired associate test (verbal memory) than subjects who reached lower estradiol levels (P<0.05). A nonsignificant trend was observed for the immediate recall condition (P<0.10) These findings were strengthened by correlations between treatment-induced estradiol levels and changes in verbal memory performance. In addition, there was an association between estradiol levels and mood changes. However mood changes were not significantly associated with changes in verbal memory performance (P>0.20). The present study supports the idea that estradiol replacement has specific effects on verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal women, with delayed recall being more affected. It suggests that these effects can occur relatively rapidly, and that there may be a dose response relationship of estradiol to memory enhancement. Furthermore, the fact that these results were obtained in women who had been menopausal for an average of 17 years before entering the study indicates that the brain maintains a sensitivity for estrogens even after years of low estradiol plasma concentrations.

VMDA\u20107/IL\u201024 regulates proliferation, invasion and tumor cell radiosensitivity: A new cancer therapy? __ The novel cytokine MDA\u20107/IL\u201024 was identified by subtractive hybridization in the mid\u20101990s as a cytokine whose expression increased during the induction of terminal differentiation, and that was either not expressed or was present at low levels in tumor cells compared to non\u2010transformed cells. Multiple studies from several laboratories have subsequently demonstrated that expression of IL\u201024 in tumor cells, but not in non\u2010transformed cells, causes their growth arrest and ultimately cell death. In addition, IL\u201024 has been noted to be a radiosensitizing cytokine, which in part is due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causing endoplasmic reticulum stress. Recent publications of Phase I trial data have shown that a recombinant adenovirus to express MDA\u20107/IL\u201024 (Ad.mda\u20107 (INGN 241)) was safe and had tumoricidal effects in patients, which argues that IL\u201024 may have therapeutic value. This review describes what is known about the impact of IL\u201024 on tumor cell biology in addition to approaches that may enhance the toxicity of this novel cytokine. © 2005 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VHemisphere and Gender Differences in Mental Rotation __ Hemisphere and gender differences in mental rotation for tachistoscopically presented stimuli were assessed in 40 right-handed university students. Twenty male and 20 female subjects each were individually administered (via computer) a mental rotation task which included 10 stimulus presentations at each of eight angular disorientations (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 315 degrees) in each visual half-field (VHF) for a total of 160 trials. Analyses of variance performed on reaction time and accuracy data revealed only a main effect for orientation. A typical mental rotation function for both the left VHF and the right VHF for both genders resulted; however, no gender x visual field interaction was found. Lack of hemisphere and gender differences provide further evidence questioning the interpretation of right-hemisphere male superiority for spatial tasks. Investigation into factors such as task complexity, stimulus familiarity, and task demands may lend further insight into hemisphere and gender differences in mental rotation.

VNonbanking Performance of Bank Holding Companies An Update from 19861990 __ There is an ongoing controversy over whether or not to extend commercial banks' nonbanking powers. Although the GlassSteagall Act of 1933 and the McFaddenPepper Act of 1927 restrict commercial banks' activities, the technological and financial innovations of the last several years have raised new questions. Whether banks should be allowed to undertake nonbanking activities How profitable are these businesses Whether banks will gain monopolistic powers Will they increase FDIC's liabilities And several other related questions. This study looks at the nonbanking activities of bank holding companies using a relatively new data source, i.e. FRY11AS reports for the years 1989 and 1990. The performance of nonbanking subsidiaries is then compared with that of commercial banks and bank holding companies. Some meaningful inferences are drawn on issues such as market concentration, profitability, capitalization, and level of problemloans of nonbanking and banking subsidiaries, as well as, consolidated bank holding companies. Results from two prior studies are further utilized to look for possible trends. Since these studies have used the same data source FRY11Q and FR Yl1AS for the years 1986 through 1988, this facilitates a trend analysis over a five year period 198690. The main conclusions are that the BHC's nonbanking activities are heavily concentrated among the top five or ten firms within each activity. However, both the number of firms as well as total assets held in most nonbanking subsidiaries have declined over the five year period. Activities considered traditional, e.g. commercial and consumer finance and mortgage banking have suffered significant losses in terms of total assets and number of firms. Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, due to the growing liberalization in interstate banking laws, BHCs can now carry on these activities in their bank subsidiaries and do not have to acquire a nonbanking subsidiary in order to capture business across state lines. Second, the glass walls separating banking from commerce may be cracking. Several states have started allowing banks to carry out some of the nonbanking activities, hence, considerably neutralizing the GlassSteagall Act. Insurance agencies and underwriting business of BHCs show the most significant growth over the five years, 19861990. Securities brokerage has held constant. Another finding is that the return on equity ROE for nonbanking firms has been lower than both the banking firms as well as the BHCs. However, this is mainly due to the relatively low equity capital levels for banks and BHCs. The nonbanking subsidiaries show fairly stable and relatively high capital ratios. Finally, for most part, nonbanking subsidiaries have a higher rate of problemloans.

VIndependent component analysis of erroneous and correct responses suggests online response control __ After errors in reaction tasks, a sharp negative wave emerges in the event\u2010related potential (ERP), the error (related) negativity (Ne or ERN). However, also after correct trials, an Ne\u2010like wave is seen, called CRN or Nc, which is much smaller than the Ne. This study tested the hypothesis whether Ne and Nc reflect the same functional process, and whether this process is linked to online response control. For this purpose, independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized with the EEG data of two types of reaction tasks: a flanker task and a mental rotation task. To control for speed\u2010accuracy effects, speed and accuracy instructions were balanced in a between subjects design. For both tasks ICA and dipole analysis revealed one component (Ne\u2010IC) explaining most of the variance for the difference between correct and erroneous trials. The Ne\u2010IC showed virtually the same features as the raw postresponse ERP, being larger for erroneous compared to correct trials and for the flanker than for the rotation task. In addition, it peaked earlier for corrected than for uncorrected errors. The results favor the hypothesis that Ne and Nc reflect the same process, which is modulated by response correctness and type of task. On the basis of the literature and the present results, we assume that this process induces online response control, which is much stronger in error than correct trials and with direct rather than indirect stimulus response mapping.

VA Study Abroad Experience in Guatemala: Learning First-Hand about Health, Education, and Social Welfare in a Low-Resource Country __ The demographic characteristics of the United States are rapidly changing as the nation becomes more culturally, racially, and ethnically diverse. In light of these changes, it is increasingly important that health care professionals develop cultural competence and understanding. Study abroad experiences can help students learn first-hand about other cultures and can promote the development of enhanced cultural sensitivity and competence. Although there are many advantages and benefits of study-abroad experiences, these experiences also present unique challenges for both students and faculty. This article presents a description of a 3-credit elective study abroad course that was offered for graduate or undergraduate credit in the summer of 2003 in Guatemala, including a description of course objectives, the process of planning and implementing the course from the facultys perspective, and one students perceptions of her study abroad experience.

VCongenital absence of aortic and pulmonary valve in a fetus with severe heart failure. __ A case of congenital absence of both aortic and pulmonary valves with severe heart failure detected prenatally by cross-sectional and pulsed and colour Doppler echocardiography is reported in small for gestational age male fetus in 17th week of gestation. Additional double outlet right ventricle, hypoplastic left ventricle, and ventricular septal defect, as well as multiple extracardiac anomalies, were found by prenatal echocardiographic investigation and confirmed by necropsy examination. Retrograde diastolic Doppler waveforms retrieved from pulmonary artery, aorta, and umbilical arteries revealed massive insufficiency throughout both the great arteries, which eliminated diastolic placental perfusion, documented by absent anterograde diastolic flow in the umbilical vein. These prenatal echocardiographic findings may contribute to an understanding of the mechanism of rapid and progressive heart failure and growth retardation in the fetus. Severe cardiac failure may explain why congenital aplasia of both the aortic and the pulmonary valves has not been described postnatally, and only two fetal cases revealed by necropsy have been published.

VPublic health approaches to end-of-life care in the UK: an online survey of palliative care services __ Aims and objectives The public health approach to end-of-life care has gained recognition over the past decade regarding its contribution to palliative care services. Terms, such as health-promoting palliative care, and compassionate communities, have entered the discourse of palliative care and practice; examples exist in the UK and globally. This scoping study aimed to determine if such initiatives were priorities for hospices in the UK and, if so, provide baseline data on the types of initiatives undertaken. Methods An online survey was designed, piloted and emailed to 220 palliative care providers across the four UK countries. It included a total of six questions. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Findings There was a 66% response rate. Of those providers, 60% indicated that public health approaches to death, dying and loss were a current priority for their organisation. Respondents identified a range of work being undertaken currently in this area. The most successful were felt to be working with schools and working directly with local community groups. The findings demonstrate the relevance of a public health approach for palliative care services and how they are currently engaging with the communities they serve. Although the approach was endorsed by the majority of respondents, various challenges were highlighted. These related to the need to balance this against service provision, and the need for more training and resources to support these initiatives, at both national and community levels.

VEfficient Anonymous Roaming and Its Security Analysis __ Abstract: The Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) model uses resuable modular components to construct indistinguishability-based key exchange protocols. The reusability of modular protocol components makes it easier to construct and prove new protocols when compared with other provably secure approaches. In this paper, we build an efficient anonymous and authenticated key exchange protocol for roaming by using the modular approach under the CK-model. Our protocol requires only four message flows and uses only standard cryptographic primitives. We also propose a one-pass counter based MT-authenticator and show its security under the assumption that there exists a MAC which is secure against chosen message attack.

VProcess generalization and the prediction of performance on mental imagery tasks __ Kosslyn (1980, 1983) theorized that performance measures on imagery tasks may vary as a function of the existence of independent processes in imaging ability. The present study determined whether improvement can be made in performance on such tasks with practice. It also considered whether performance on such tasks improves with practice and whether this improvement generalizes. Experiment 1 determined whether improvement in a mental rotation task generalizes to improvement in a geometric analogies task, with both tasks weighted in Kosslyn's find process, but not in a line drawing memory task weighted in Kosslyn's regenerate process. In Experiment 2, we examined generalization in improvement from a geometric analogies task to a mental rotation task. In Experiment 3, we tested whether improvement in an animal imagery task (Kosslyn, 1975) generalizes to improvement in a line drawing memory task, with both tasks weighted in Kosslyn's regenerate process, but not to improvement in a mental rotation task. Performance improved with practice on all tasks. Furthermore, performance improved from one task to another only if both tasks loaded on the same process.

VSpatial cognition, mobility, and reproductive success in northwestern Namibia __ Males occupy a larger range than females in many mammal populations including humans, and show an advantage in certain spatial-cognitive laboratory tasks. Evolutionary psychologists have explained these patterns by arguing that an increase in spatial ability facilitated navigation, which allowed range expansion in pursuit of additional mating and hunting opportunities. This study evaluates this hypothesis in a population with navigational demands similar to those that faced many of our ancestors, the Twe and Tjimba of northwestern Namibia. Twe and Tjimba men have larger visiting ranges than women and are more accurate in both spatial (mental rotations) and navigational (accuracy pointing to distant locations) tasks. Men who perform better on the spatial task not only travel farther than other men, but also have children with more women. These findings offer strong support for the relationship between sex differences in spatial ability and ranging behavior, and identify male mating competition as a possible selective pressure shaping this pattern.

Structural characterization by single crystal X\u2010ray diffraction revealed an Eu8 cluster unit which is centered by an oxide anion. The Eu8\u2010cluster polyhedron can be described as a bicapped octahedron or a triangulated dodecahedron. Each of the triangular faces of the cluster is capped by one \u03bc3\u2010hydroxo group. Fourteen \u03bc2\u2010triflate (CF3SO3\u2212) anions bridge via oxygen the cluster edges. Together with two \u03bc1\u2010terminal coordinating triflate anions they complete the cluster unit. Six cations from the ionic liquid counterbalance the cluster charge. Additionally, 1.5 HOTf molecules per Eu8\u2010cluster unit are incorporated in the crystal structure of the title compound.

VThe Malleability of Spatial Skills: A Meta-Analysis of Training Studies __ Having good spatial skills strongly predicts achievement and attainment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields (e.g., Shea, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2001; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow,2009). Improving spatial skills is therefore of both theoretical and practical importance. To determine whether and to what extent training and experience can improve these skills, we meta-analyzed 217 research studies investigating the magnitude, moderators, durability, and generalizability of training on spatial skills. After eliminating outliers, the average effect size (Hedges's g) for training relative to control was 0.47 (SE // 0.04). Training effects were stable and were not affected by delays between training and posttesting. Training also transferred to other spatial tasks that were not directly trained. We analyzed the effects of several moderators, including the presence and type of control groups, sex, age, and type of training. Additionally, we included a theoretically motivated typology of spatial skills that emphasizes 2 dimensions: intrinsic versus extrinsic and static versus dynamic (Newcombe & Shipley, in press). Finally, we consider the potential educational and policy implications of directly training spatial skills. Considered together, the results suggest that spatially enriched education could pay substantial dividends in increasing participation in mathematics, science, and engineering.

VIndividual Differences in the Mental Rotation Skills of Turkish Prospective Teachers __ This study investigated the effects of gender, academic performance and preschool education on mental rotation skills among Turkish prospective teachers. A total of 525 undergraduate students (364 female) from a government university located in western Turkey completed the Mental Rotation Test (MRT). A three-way [2 (gender) × 5 (academic performance) × 2 (preschool education)] between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that males outperformed females in mental rotation performance (d = .86). Significant effects of preschool education and academic performance on MRT scores were also observed. Significant interactions were observed between gender and academic performance and academic performance and preschool education. There was also a significant three-way interaction of gender, academic performance and preschool education. An interaction between gender and preschool education failed to reach significance.

VMental rotation for spatial environment recognition __ We investigated the importance of retinal and body inclination in the recognition of spatial environment. The paradigm involved the recognition, in body upright and tilted conditions, of tilted images intervals of 15 from 0 to 90 leftward and rightward respective to head coordinates of known spatial layouts encountered while walking in Paris. The analysis of reaction times was consistent with the subjects mentally rotating the spatial layout so that the environment was subjectively vertical before making their decisions. In contrast, when the body was roll-tilted (33), overall reaction time was not affected; however, reaction time and spatial layout tilt with respect to the head were correlated when the body was tilted but not when upright. Both results indicate that gravity was slightly important in performing the task.

VMental rotations, a group test of three-dimensional spatial visualization __ new paper-and-pencil test of spatial visualization was consrrucred from the figures used in the chronometric study of Shepard and Metzler (1971). In large samples, the new test displayed substantial internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson 20 = .88), a rest-retest reliability (.83), and consistent sex differences over the entire range of ages investigated. Correlations with other measures indicated strong association with tests of spatial visualization and virtually no association with tests of verbal ability.

VMental rotation performance and the effect of gender in fourth graders and adults __ Whereas a gender effect favouring males in adults' mental rotation performance can be reliably found, the respective gender effect in children's performance does not appear consistently in the literature. Therefore, this study investigated whether there is a ''crucial'' time slot on infantile development when a gender effect is detectable. Following Johnson and Meade's (1987) hypothesis that age ten might be crucial, we investigated 96 fourth graders\u2014split into two age groups (mean: 9.3 vs. 10.3 years)\u2014and 48 adults that performed the MRT (Peters et al., 1995). We observed large gender effects in older children as well as in adults. However, the younger children did not reveal a significant gender effect, although effect sizes indicated a small-to-medium effect. Surprisingly, the performance of women, older girls, and younger girls did not differ significantly, whereas older boys and adults clearly outperformed younger boys. Possible reasons for these effects are discussed.

VNot all anxious individuals get lost: Trait anxiety and mental rotation ability interact to explain performance in map-based route learning in men __ Navigation through an environment is a fundamental human activity. Although group differences in navigational ability are documented (e.g., gender), little is known about traits that predict these abilities. Apart from a well-established link between mental rotational abilities and navigational learning abilities, recent studies point to an influence of trait anxiety on the formation of internal cognitive spatial representations. However, it is unknown whether trait anxiety affects the processing of information obtained through externalized representations such as maps. Here, we addressed this question by taking into account emerging evidence indicating impaired performance in executive tasks by high trait anxiety specifically in individuals with lower executive capacities. For this purpose, we tested 104 male participants, previously characterised on trait anxiety and mental rotation ability, on a newly-designed map-based route learning task, where participants matched routes presented dynamically on a city map to one presented immediately before (same/different judgments). We predicted an interaction between trait anxiety and mental rotation ability, specifically that performance in the route learning task would be negatively affected by anxiety in participants with low mental rotation ability. Importantly, and as predicted, an interaction between anxiety and mental rotation ability was observed: trait anxiety negatively affected participants with low\u2014but not high\u2014mental rotation ability. Our study reveals a detrimental role of trait anxiety in map-based route learning and specifies a disadvantage in the processing of map representations for high-anxious individuals with low mental rotation abilities.

VAt the mercy of strategies: the role of motor representations in language understanding __ Classical cognitive theories hold that word representations in the brain are abstract and amodal, and are independent of the objects\u2019 sensorimotor properties they refer to. An alternative hypothesis emphasizes the importance of bodily processes in cognition: the representation of a concept appears to be crucially dependent upon perceptual-motor processes that relate to it. Thus, understanding action-related words would rely upon the same motor structures that also support the execution of the same actions. In this context, motor simulation represents a key component. Our approach is to draw parallels between the literature on mental rotation and the literature on action verb/sentence processing. Here we will discuss recent studies on mental imagery, mental rotation, and language that clearly demonstrate how motor simulation is neither automatic nor necessary to language understanding. These studies have shown that motor representations can or cannot be activated depending on the type of strategy the participants adopt to perform tasks involving motor phrases. On the one hand, participants may imagine the movement with the body parts used to carry out the actions described by the verbs (i.e., motor strategy); on the other, individuals may solve the task without simulating the corresponding movements (i.e., visual strategy). While it is not surprising that the motor strategy is at work when participants process action-related verbs, it is however striking that sensorimotor activation has been reported also for imageable concrete words with no motor content, for \u201cnon-words\u201d with regular phonology, for pseudo-verb stimuli, and also for negations. Based on the extant literature, we will argue that implicit motor imagery is not uniquely used when a body-related stimulus is encountered, and that it is not the type of stimulus that automatically triggers the motor simulation but the type of strategy. Finally, we will also comment on the view that sensorimotor activations are subjected to a top-down modulation.

VEffects of Stimulus Type and Strategy on Mental Rotation Network: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis __ We can predict how an object would look like if we were to see it from different viewpoints. The brain network governing mental rotation (MR) has been studied using a variety of stimuli and tasks instructions. By using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis we tested whether different MR networks can be modulated by the type of stimulus (body vs. non-body parts) or by the type of tasks instructions (motor imagery-based vs. non-motor imagery-based MR instructions). Testing for the bodily and non-bodily stimulus axis revealed a bilateral sensorimotor activation for bodily-related as compared to non-bodily-related stimuli and a posterior right lateralized activation for non-bodily-related as compared to bodily-related stimuli. A top-down modulation of the network was exerted by the MR tasks instructions with a bilateral (preferentially sensorimotor left) network for motor imagery- vs. non-motor imagery-based MR instructions and the latter activating a preferentially posterior right occipito-temporal-parietal network. The present quantitative meta-analysis summarizes and amends previous descriptions of the brain network related to MR and shows how it is modulated by top-down and bottom-up experimental factors.

VPath integration following temporal lobectomy in humans __ Path integration, a component of spatial navigation, is the process used to determine position information on the basis of information about distance and direction travelled derived from self-motion cues. Following on from studies in the animal literature that seem to support the role of the hippocampal formation in path integration, this facility was investigated in humans with focal brain lesions. Thirty-three neurosurgical patients (17 left temporal lobectomy, LTL; 16 right temporal lobectomy, RTL) and 16 controls were tested on a number of blindfolded tasks designed to investigate path integration and on a number of additional control tasks (assessing mental rotation and left\u2013right orientation). In a test of the ability to compute a homing vector, the subjects had to return to the start after being led along a route consisting of two distances and one turn. Patients with RTL only were impaired at estimating the turn required to return to the start. On a second task, route reproduction was tested by requiring the subjects to reproduce a route consisting of two distances and one turn; the RTL group only were also impaired at reproducing the turn, but this impairment did not correlate with the homing vector deficit. There were no group differences on tasks where subjects were required to reproduce a single distance or a single turn. The results indicate that path integration is impaired in RTL patients only and suggest that the right temporal lobe plays a role in idiothetic spatial memory.

VMental rotation of body parts and sensory temporal discrimination in fixed dystonia __ Fixed dystonia is an uncommon but severely disabling condition typically affecting young women following a minor peripheral injury. There is no evidence of any structural lesions of the central nervous system nor any clear peripheral nerve or root damage. Electrophysiological techniques such as short intracortical inhibition, cortical silent period and a plasticity inducing protocol have revealed similarities but also differences compared to classical mobile dystonia. To further explore the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia we compared mental rotation of body parts and sensory temporal discrimination in 11 patients with fixed dystonia, 11 patients with classical mobile dystonia and 10 healthy controls. In the mental rotation task subjects were presented with realistic photos of left or right hands, feet and the head of a young women with a black patch covering the left or the right eye in six different orientations. Subjects had to verbally report the laterality of the presented stimuli. To assess sensory temporal discrimination subjects were asked to discriminate whether pairs of visual, tactile (electrical), or visuo\u2010tactile stimuli were simultaneous or sequential (temporal discrimination threshold) and in the latter case which stimulus preceded the other (temporal order judgement). In accordance with previous studies patients with mobile dystonia were abnormal in mental rotation and temporal discrimination, whereas patients with fixed dystonia were only impaired in mental rotation. Possible explanations for this deficit may include the influence of the abnormal body posture itself, a shared predisposing pathophysiology for mobile and fixed dystonia, or a body image disturbance. These findings add information to the developing pathophysiological picture of fixed dystonia. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society

VMolecular Modelling of \u03b2 Turns in a Cyclic Melanotropin __ \u03b1\u2010Melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1\u2010MSH) is a tridecapeptide which interacts with a family of G protein\u2010coupled receptors, the melanocortin receptors, to cause its biological effects. We have modelled the low energy conformations of the \u03b1\u2010MSH derivatives as part of a project to probe the receptor binding conformation of melanocortins, and also to design ligands for targeting cytotoxic drugs to MC1 receptors expressed by melanoma cells.

VMental rotation of tactual stimuli __ Three experiments involving different angular orientations of tactual shapes were performed. In experiment 1 subjects were timed as they made \u2018same-different\u2019 judgments about two successive rotated shapes. Results showed that no rotation effect is obtained, i.e., reaction times and error percentages do not increase linearly with rotation angle. The same negative results were found in experiment 2, in which subjects were similarly timed while they made mirror-image discriminations. In experiment 3 a single-stimulus paradigm was used and subjects were asked to decide if a rotated stimulus was a \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018reversed\u2019 version. Reaction times increased linearly with angular departure from the vertical. Therefore, for tactual stimuli too, this study confirms previous results, which suggest that a mental rotation strategy only occurs if it is facilitated by both type of task and type of stimulus. Results also show a significant difference between hands, and between hands and type of response. Implied hemispheric differences are discussed.

VApplication of the `double spike' technique to Pb-isotope geochronology __ New Pb-isotope data are presented for three suites of carbonate-bearing sedimentary rocks from the Archaean and Proterozoic of Western Australia. The measured data are corrected for instrumental mass fractionation using both conventional and double-spike techniques, with the results contrasted on isochron diagrams. Compared with the data corrected using conventional methods, the double-spike-corrected data show a significant improvement in all cases: the isochrons produced are more tightly constrained, resulting in lower uncertainties in the age estimates obtained and marked improvements in MSWD values.While highlighting the enormous potential for the direct dating of carbonate sequences throughout the geological record, this study demonstrates the improvements possible using double-spike correction for mass fractionation\u2014an issue pertinent to all aspects of Pb-isotope geochronology.

VPre\u2010weaning morbidity and mortality of llamas and alpacas __ Objectives\u2003 To describe the morbidity and mortality patterns and identify factors associated with morbidity in pre\u2010weaning llamas and alpacas. Design\u2003 Cross\u2010sectional observational study of 287 crias born on four farms in Ohio, USA Procedure\u2003 Historical data representing all crias born over a 6\u2010year period were obtained from two llama farms and two alpaca farms in Ohio. Multivariable generalised linear mixed effects regression models were used to identify factors associated with morbidity outcomes. Results\u2003 In total, 105 (37%) of the llamas and alpacas had some reported morbidity during the pre\u2010weaning period, and mortality rate was 2.1%. In addition, 51 (18%) of llamas and alpacas experienced morbidity because of infectious disease, and 47 (16%) experienced morbidity during the neonatal period. The three most commonly reported morbidity events were undifferentiated diarrhoea (23%), umbilical hernia (16%) and unspecified infectious disease (15%). Difficult birth was an important risk factor for pre\u2010weaning morbidity in this population. Conclusions\u2003 Camelid veterinarians and their clients can expect that pre\u2010weaning health events are common among crias, although mortality is low. Crias experiencing difficult births may require additional monitoring for health events during the pre\u2010weaning period.

VFunctional activation of the human brain during mental rotation __ Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron emission tomography during the performance of tasks that required cognitive spatial transformations of alphanumeric stimuli. In the mirror image task, the subjects were required to discriminate between the normal and the mirror images of alphanumeric stimuli presented in the upright orientation. In the mental rotation task, the same judgement was required, but now the stimuli were presented in various orientations other than the upright one. The subjects therefore had to rotate the stimuli, in mind, into the upright position before making their decision. In relation to the control task, which involved discrimination of these same stimuli but not any form of mental transformation, there were significant increases in the right postero-superior parietal cortex and the left inferior parietal cortex in both experimental tasks. For mental rotation, specific activity was seen only within the left inferior parietal region and the right head of the caudate nucleus. These results specified the parietal areas involved in a purely cognitive spatial process and demonstrated a close interaction between these areas and the anterior neostriatum and certain lateral frontal cortical areas in the discrimination of rotated forms of stimuli.

VSelective right parietal lobe activation during mental rotation __ Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with PET in seven healthy subjects while they carried out a mental rotation task in which they decided whether alphanumeric characters presented in different orientations were in their canonical form or mirror-reversed. Consistent with previous findings, subjects took proportionally longer to respond as characters were rotated further from the upright, indicating that they were mentally rotating the characters to the upright position before making a decision. We used a parametric design in which we varied the mental rotation demands in an incremental fashion while keeping all other aspects of the task constant. In four different scanning conditions, 10, 40, 70 or 100% of the stimuli presented during the scan required mental rotation while the rest were upright. The statistical parametric mapping technique was used to identify areas where changes in rCBF were correlated with the rotational demands of the task. Significant activation was found in only one area located in the right posterior parietal lobe, centred on the intraparietal sulcus (Brodmann area 7). The experimental literature on monkeys and humans suggests that this area is involved in a variety of spatial transformations. Our results contribute evidence that such transformations are recruited during mental rotation and add to a body of evidence which suggests that the right posterior parietal lobe is important for carrying out visuospatial transformations.

VA therapeutic group in the community for the elderly with functional psychiatric illnesses __ We describe a closed therapeutic group run in a community setting for the elderly with functional psychiatric illnesses. The aim of the group was to promote mental health and self\u2010confidence and to reduce psychiatric morbidity. A directive approach was taken and members were encouraged to seek solutions to their problems. Outcome was good on both objective and subjective measures. Difficulties in running the group are discussed. Finally, it is suggested that such groups may be an effective means both of improving mental health and of utilizing limited health service resources, and warrant further research.

VResponse preparation begins before mental rotation is finished: Evidence from event-related brain potentials __ Behavioral data (response time (RT) and accuracy) and psychophysiological data (event-related brain potentials or ERPs, and lateralized readiness potential or LRP) were studied in an experiment in which rotated alphanumeric characters were presented normally or mirror-reversed. In half of the trials, character classification (letter versus digit) determined whether or not the response was to be executed (go versus nogo) and parity determined the responding hand. In the other half, classification determined the responding hand and parity determined go versus nogo. LRP data indicated that response preparation occurred before mental rotation was finished. These data contradict strictly sequential discrete models of information processing and suggest continuous flow of information.PsycINFO classification: 2340

VPsychophysiological correlates of dynamic imagery __ Brain Electrical Activity Maps were recorded from 20 subjects whilst performing: (a) the Vandenberg & Kuse Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and: (b) the Isaac, Marks & Russell Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ), and under control conditions. Subjects were classified as good or poor imagers, first on the basis of their VMIQ scores, and secondly on their MRT scores. Alpha, beta 1 and beta 2 at different cortical regions were compared between groups and between task performance and control conditions. During MRT significant reductions in alpha amplitude were found over both right and left parietal areas and over the left frontal region. In beta 1 non\u2010significant trends in the same direction were observed in the same regions found to be significant in alpha. Non\u2010significant trends in beta 2 were observed over the right parietal and frontal regions. No differences in amplitude at any frequency band were found between good and poor VMIQ scorers but subjects with high MRT scores showed greater alpha amplitude at many sites in the parietal, parieto\u2010occipital and frontal areas than subjects with low MRT scores. During VMIQ testing the VMIQ high imagers showed a non\u2010significant trend towards higher alpha amplitude at frontal regions and some scattered parietal and occipital sites and significantly higher levels of beta 2 in the left frontal region. However, no differences were found between imagery and control conditions. The results confirm the involvement of motor as well as spatial processes in dynamic imagery.

VStudies on stability of rapeseed wet gum as a source of pharmaceutical lecithin __ Abstract: Lecithin wet gum with high water content is less stable during storage than dry lecithin. Deoiling and dehydrating the fresh gum can result in a purified lecithin of high quality. The stability of rapeseed wet gum obtained from double-zero rapeseed varieties was determined at various temperatures. The effect of storage time on volatile substances, acetone insolubles, neutral lipids and acid, iodine, and peroxide values were investigated. The rapeseed wet gum stored a little above 20°C is stable for up to ten days, although in the frozen state (\u221220°C) no changes in general composition, acid, iodine, and peroxide values were observed during 24 mon of storage.

VTime-resolved resonance shadow imaging of laser-produced lead and tin plasmas __ The resonance shadowgraph technique is proposed and evaluated for the imaging of laser-produced plasmas. In this work, the shadowgraphs of lead and tin plasmas and post-plasma plumes were obtained by igniting the plasma on the surface of pure lead or tin, and illuminating the plumes using an expanded dye laser beam tuned in resonance with a strong resonance lead (283.3 nm) or tin (286.3 nm) transition. The image of the strongly absorbing plasma and post-plasma plume was then formed on a fluorescent screen placed behind the plasma, and was recorded by use of a TV camera, a video recorder, and a computer. In addition, the UV photodecomposition of lead and tin dimers or large clusters, present in the atmosphere, was visualized using this method. The evolution of the plasmas was studied at different argon pressures (from 50 to 1000 mbar). A shock wave produced by laser ablation was also observed and its speed was measured as a function of the argon pressure and the delay time between the ablating and the imaging lasers.

VSetting priorities in the new NHS: can purchasers use cost-utility information? __ It could be argued that the success of the new NHS depends, to some extent, on the production of accurate cost-utility information. This raises questions about the quality of this information, whether it can be transferred from one study setting to another and whether such information can reasonably be used \u2018at the negotiating table\u2019. The quality of some studies is open to question. Some agreement is needed on issues of principle and more work is required to make cost-utility analyses more applicable locally.

VNew 3He/4He refrigerator __ The sensitivity increase in bolometers obtained by operating temperatures of 1 K (helium-4) and 0.3 K (helium-3), with respect to standard bolometers cooled at pumped 4He temperature, represents in infrared and submillimetric astronomy a remarkable step forward in applications both on large ground telescopes and on stratospheric balloons. The characteristics are introduced of a double stage refrigerator (4He/3He) which allows a temperature of nearly 300 mK to be reached, starting from a temperature of 4.2 K. No moving parts and external links are involved, except for the electric leads, so as to exploit only the condensation and cryosorption cycles of 4He and 3He, without pumping on the main 4He bath.

VNegotiating the meaning of artefacts: Branding in a semeiotic perspective __ The article investigates the question of how we ascribe meaning to artefacts (understood in its broadest sense, also including brands). The short answer is that meaning is ascribed to brands and artefact through an ongoing negotiating process between an utterer and an interpreter. This means that semeiosis is communication in its broadest sense. The negotiation process between utterer and interpreter aims at creating an interpreting habit \u2014 a common consent on which upon the meaning of the artefact rests.

VSynthesis and Characterization of a Highly Soluble Aromatic Polyimide from 4,4\u2032\u2010Methylenebis(2\u2010tert\u2010butylaniline) __ 4,4\u2032\u2010Methylenebis(2\u2010tert\u2010butylaniline) was synthesized and reacted with pyromellitic dianhydride to produce a polyimide that showed excellent solubility in conventional organic solvents. Solutions of this polyimide could be cast into transparent, flexible and tough films. The number\u2010average molecular weight, as determined by means of gel permeation chromatography, was 8.9×104 g/mol and the polydispersity index was 1.97. The glass transition temperature was found to be 217°C. The polyimide did not show appreciable decomposition up to 500°C under a nitrogen atmosphere.

VRegional monitoring of infrasound events using multiple arrays: application to Utah and Washington State __ In this paper, we present an integrated set of algorithms for the automatic detection, association, and location of low-frequency acoustic events using regional networks of infrasound arrays. Here, low-frequency acoustic events are characterized by transient signals, which may arise from a range of natural and anthropogenic sources, examples of which include (but are not limited to) earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, explosions, rockets and bolides. First, we outline a new technique for detecting infrasound signals that works successfully in the presence of correlated noise. We use an F-statistic, sequentially adapted to ambient noise conditions, in order to obtain detections at a given statistical significance while accounting for real background noise. At each array, individual arrivals are then grouped together based on measured delay-times and backazimuths. Each signal is identified as either a first or later arrival. First arrivals at spatially separated arrays are then associated using a grid-search method to form events. Preliminary event locations are calculated from the geographic means and spreads of grid nodes associated with each event. We apply the technique to regional infrasound networks in Utah and Washington State. In Utah, over a period of approximately 1 month, we obtain a total of 276 events recorded at three arrays in a geographic region of 6 × 4°. For four ground-truth explosions in Utah, the automatic algorithm detects, associates, and locates the events within an average offset of 5.4 km to the actual explosion locations. In Washington State, the algorithm locates numerous events that are associated with a large coalmine in Centralia, Washington. An example mining-explosion from Centralia is located within 8.2 km of the mine. The methodology and results presented here provide an initial framework for assessing the capability of infrasound networks for regional infrasound monitoring, in particular by quantifying detection thresholds and localization errors.

VEffect of Organic Acids and Plant Extracts on\u2002Escherichia coli\u2002O157:H7,\u2002Listeria monocytogenes,\u2002and\u2002Salmonella\u2002Typhimurium in Broth Culture Model and Chicken Meat Systems __ ABSTRACT:\u2002 Foodborne illness due to consumption of products contaminated with\u2002Salmonella\u2002Typhimurium (S.T.),\u2002Listeria monocytogenes\u2002(L.m.), and\u2002Escherichia coli\u2002O157:H7 (E.c.) results in many deaths and significant economic losses each year. In this study, acetic (AA), citric acid (CA), lactic acid (LA), malic acid (MA), and tartaric acid (TA) and grape seed (GS), green tea (GT), bitter melon seed (BMS), rasum, and fenugreek (FG) extracts were investigated as inhibitors against\u2002S.T.,\u2002L.m.,\u2002and\u2002E.c. in both broth\u2010culture and meat systems. Brain Heart Infusion solutions containing 18.7, 37.5, and 75.0 mM organic acids and 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL extracts were challenged with approximately log 6 CFU/mL\u2002S.T.,\u2002L.m., and\u2002E.c. A pH\u2010adjusted control was included to determine pH effect on exhibited antibacterial activity. For the meat system, 1 to 2 g chicken breast pieces were vacuum\u2010infused with CA/MA/TA acid at 75 and 150 mM and GS and GT at 3000, 6000, and 9000 ppm in a partial factorial arrangement. GT and GS showed considerable activity in broth\u2010culture. All organic acids were effective in broth\u2010culture at 75 mM after 24 h (P\u2002< 0.05). CA and TA were effective at 37.5 mM. CA/MA/TA at 150.0 mM were the most effective in the meat system, reducing\u2002E.c.,\u2002L.m.\u2002and\u2002S.T. by >5, >2, and 4\u20106 log CFU/g, respectively, although all organic acids showed some antibacterial activity at 75.0 and 150.0 mM.

VDomain specificity of spatial expertise: the case of video game players __ Two experiments examined whether video game expertise transfers to performance on measures of spatial ability. In Experiment 1, skilled Tetris players outperformed non\u2010Tetris players on mental rotation of shapes that were either identical to or very similar to Tetris shapes, but not on other tests of spatial ability. The pattern of performance on those mental rotation tasks revealed that skilled Tetris Players used the same mental rotation procedures as non\u2010Tetris players, but when Tetris shapes were used, they executed them more quickly. In Experiment 2, non\u2010Tetris players who received 12 hours of Tetris\u2010playing experience did not differ from matched control students in pretest\u2010to\u2010posttest gains on tests of spatial ability. However, Tetris\u2010experienced participants were more likely to use an alternative type of mental rotation for Tetris shapes than were Tetris\u2010inexperienced participants. The results suggest that spatial expertise is highly domain\u2010specific and does not transfer broadly to other domains. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VAn oxygen deficient fluorite with a tunnel structure: Bi8La10O27 __ A new lanthanum bismuth oxide, Bi8La10O27, has been synthesized. It crystallizes in the Immm space group with the following parameters: a = 12.079 (2) Å, b = 16.348 (4) Å, c = 4.0988 (5) Å. Its structure was determined from powder X-ray and neutron diffraction data. It can be described as an oxygen deficient fluorite superstructure (a \u2248 3aF \u221a2, b \u2248 3aF, c \u2248 aF \u221a2) in which bismuth and lanthanum, as well as oxygen vacancies, are ordered. The structure consists of fully occupied (110) or (110) lanthanum planes (La) which alternate with mixed { Bi La} planes and fully occupied oxygen planes (A) which alternate with two sorts of oxygen deficient (110) or (110) planes (B and C) according to the sequence -[ La A B { Bi La} C C { Bi La} B A [-. The anionic distribution determines tunnels where the bismuth ions are located, forming diamond-shaped based tunnels. The coordination of bismuth and lanthanum is discussed. The high thermal factor of some oxygen atoms suggests that this oxide exhibits ionic conductivity.

VEffects of prolonged weightlessness on mental rotation of three-dimensional objects __ Abstract: Previous experiments have suggested that the analysis of visual images could be a gravity-dependent process. We investigated this hypothesis using a mental rotation paradigm with pictures of three-dimensional objects during a 26-day orbital flight aboard the Soviet MIR station. The analysis of cosmonauts' response times showed that the mental rotation task is not greatly impaired in weightlessness. On the contrary, there are indications of a facilitation as: (1) the average rotation time per degree was shorter inflight than on the ground; (2) this difference seemed to be particularly marked for stimuli calling for roll axis rotations. However several factors may be responsible for this difference which was not obvious in one subject. Further experiments will have to test if this effect is really due to exposure to microgravity.

VAre cognitive sex differences disappearing? Evidence from Spanish populations __ Sex differences in cognitive abilities were determined using the norms from two standardizations of the Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) and the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) conducted between 1979 and 1995 in Spain. The standardized sex differences (ds) were computed separately for the DAT and the PMA subscales. Males scored higher in the DAT subscales Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Ability, Spatial Relations and Mechanical Reasoning, as well as in the PMA subscales Numerical Ability and Mental Rotation. Females scored higher in Inductive Reasoning (PMA-R) in the 1979 and 1995 standardizations. Taken together, these data do not support the hypothesis that cognitive sex differences are disappearing: there are still some differences favoring females and still some differences favoring males.

VSocial and environmental metrics for US real estate portfolios __ Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the availability of information in the USA for measuring the social and environmental performance of real estate portfolios. Designmethodologyapproach A search is conducted for relevant indicator data sources using internet, library and government resources. Priority is placed on information that could be accessed on line, by any user, free of charge, from reputable sources, using available search parameters, for all types of properties and for any properties anywhere in the USA. Useful sources are identified and assessed using data quality indicators. Information gaps are also identified. A previously published method is adapted for comparing the social and environmental performance of properties and portfolios and data collected from identified sources are used to illustrate the construction of indices useful for making comparisons. Findings Nationwide data sources are available for most important dimensions with greater availability for the most important ones. There are, however, important data gaps related to such issues as water use, day light and ventilation, aesthetics and others. Most sources only require a property address for queries but do not support batch processing. There are no data quality problems for most data sources but a substantial minority of the sources does have at least one data quality issue. Available data can be used to construct indices useful for comparing properties and portfolios. Practical implications Fund managers can use these results to compile extrafinancial information on sustainability and corporate social responsibility and socially responsible investors can use them to evaluate investment opportunities. Originalityvalue This is the first effort to identify and assess data sources needed for creating responsible and sustainable metrics and indices and responds to demand for better metrics in the field of sustainable and responsible property investing.

VAn X-ray diffraction study of the effect of \u03b1-tocopherol on the structure and phase behaviour of bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine __ The effect of \u03b1-tocopherol on the thermotropic phase transition behaviour of aqueous dispersions of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine was examined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction methods. The temperature of gel to liquid-crystalline (L\u03b2\u2192L\u03b1) phase transition decreases from 49.5 to 44.5°C and temperature range where gel and liquid-crystalline phases coexist increases from 4 to 8°C with increasing concentration of \u03b1-tocopherol up to 20 mol%. Codispersion of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine containing 2.5 mol% \u03b1-tocopherol gives similar lamellar diffraction patterns as those of the pure phospholipid both in heating and cooling scans. With 5 mol% \u03b1-tocopherol in the phospholipid, however, an inverted hexagonal phase is induced which coexists with the lamellar gel phase at temperatures just before transition to liquid-crystalline lamellar phase. The presence of 10 mol% \u03b1-tocopherol shows a more pronounced inverted hexagonal phase in the lamellar gel phase but, in addition, another non-lamellar phase appears with the lamellar liquid-crystalline phase at higher temperature. This non-lamellar phase coexists with the lamellar liquid-crystalline phase of the pure phospholipid and can be indexed by six diffraction orders to a cubic phase of Pn3m or Pn3 space groups and with a lattice constant of 12.52±0.01 nm at 84°C. In mixed aqueous dispersions containing 20 mol% \u03b1-tocopherol, only inverted hexagonal phase and lamellar phase were observed. The only change seen in the wide-angle scattering region was a transition from sharp symmetrical diffraction peak at 0.43 nm, typical of gel phases, to broad peaks centred at 0.47 nm signifying disordered hydrocarbon chains in all the mixtures examined. Electron density calculations through the lamellar repeat of the gel phase using six orders of reflection indicated no difference in bilayer thickness due to the presence of 10 mol% \u03b1-tocopherol. The results were interpreted to indicate that \u03b1-tocopherol is not randomly distributed throughout the phospholipid molecules oriented in bilayer configuration, but it exists either as domains coexisting with gel phase bilayers of pure phospholipid at temperatures lower than Tm or, at higher temperatures, as inverted hexagonal phase consisting of a defined stoichiometry of phospholipid and \u03b1-tocopherol molecules.

VPopulation change and environmental problems in the Mid-Boteti region of Botswana __ Abstract: The paper examines the significance of population change in environmental degradation with respect to specific resources use changes in the semi-arid Mid-Boteti region in Botswana. In Mid-Boteti, the combination of population change and new land-use practices which exclude traditional multiple communal resource use from large tracts of land, have led to the degradation of the remaining communal lands and a growing number of poor people who have lost access to cattle and to subsistence hunting and gathering. The loss of these resource use options has reduced the ability of the poor to cope with the environmental conditions, in particular with drought, making them not only dependent upon government drought relief programmes but also forcing them to over exploit free resources or to change to environmentally damaging practices such as goat husbandry and dry-land cultivation on marginal soils. When considering population-environment relationships it is crucial to take into account the socio-economic divisions in the society. For the rich there is often not clear link between population growth and environmental problems, because they have the possibility to reserve resources for their exclusive use. For the poor, however, there exists often a clear relation between population growth, reduced access to environmental resources due to exclusion and increased competition and resulting environmental problems which negatively affect their quality of life. Changes in population distribution as well as population growth were found to play a major role in increasing environmental problems related to expanding resource use in the Mid-Boteti region. But there are also other crucial role players such as increased use of technology under conditions of inappropriate management, commercialisation and growing poverty. It is the combination of population change and these factors which causes serious environmental problems.

VSuperior spatial memory of women: Stronger evidence for the gathering hypothesis __ Male and female college students played the commercial game MemoryTM, which required them to recall the location of previously viewed items, and also completed a 20-item mental rotation task. As is typical, males performed better than females (d = .67) on the mental rotation task. In contrast, females outperformed males by a large margin (d = \u2212.89) on the memory task. Performance on the two tasks was correlated for females, but not for males. The reversal of sex differences between tasks suggests that spatial ability is not a unitary trait and that different kinds of spatial processing may have been important for males and females in the EEA (environment of evolutionary adoptedness). The MemoryTM game appears to mimic the cognitive demands of foraging better than previous spatial memory tasks.

By using a class of quantified-first order formulae to symbolically represent array-based systems, we propose methods to check safety (invariance) and liveness (recurrence) properties on top of Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers. We find hypotheses under which the verification procedures for such properties can be fully mechanized.

VEcological consequences of hydropower development in Central America: impacts of small dams and water diversion on neotropical stream fish assemblages __ Small dams for hydropower have caused widespread alteration of Central American rivers, yet much of recent development has gone undocumented by scientists and conservationists. We examined the ecological effects of a small hydropower plant (Doña Julia Hydroelectric Center) on two low\u2010order streams (the Puerto Viejo River and Quebradon stream) draining a mountainous area of Costa Rica. Operation of the Doña Julia plant has dewatered these streams, reducing discharge to \u223c10% of average annual flow. This study compared fish assemblage composition and aquatic habitat upstream and downstream of diversion dams on two streams and along a \u223c4\u2009km dewatered reach of the Puerto Viejo River in an attempt to evaluate current instream flow recommendations for regulated Costa Rican streams. Our results indicated that fish assemblages directly upstream and downstream of the dam on the third order Puerto Viejo River were dissimilar, suggesting that the small dam (<\u200915\u2009m high) hindered movement of fishes. Along the \u223c4\u2009km dewatered reach of the Puerto Viejo River, species count increased with downstream distance from the dam. However, estimated species richness and overall fish abundance were not significantly correlated with downstream distance from the dam. Our results suggested that effects of stream dewatering may be most pronounced for a subset of species with more complex reproductive requirements, classified as equilibrium\u2010type species based on their life\u2010history. In the absence of changes to current operations, we expect that fish assemblages in the Puerto Viejo River will be increasingly dominated by opportunistic\u2010type, colonizing fish species. Operations of many other small hydropower plants in Costa Rica and other parts of Central America mirror those of Doña Julia; the methods and results of this study may be applicable to some of those projects.

VOn the relationship between solution strategies in two mental rotation tasks __ Individual differences in solution strategies have frequently been reported for different measures of mental rotation (MR) ability. In the present study (N = 346 German students), we investigated the relationship between solution strategies on two tests commonly used to identify different patterns of strategies: the Mental Rotations Test (MRT; Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978; Peters, Laeng, Lathan, Jackson, Zaiouna, & Richardson, 1995) and the Cube Comparison Test (CCT; Amthauer, 1953; Amthauer, Brocke, Liepmann, & Beauducel, 2001). The results revealed high convergent validity of the solution strategy assignment. Individuals using analytic (holistic) strategies on the MRT tended to use analytic (holistic) strategies also on the CCT. More females than males were identified as users of analytic solution strategies on the MRT. In addition, males tended to generally show a faster performance than did females. Our findings suggest that solution strategies in MR generalize across different tasks and are not an artifact of a particular test.

VEffect of stereo television presentation on \u201cmental rotation\u201d __ The effect of stereo television presentation on \u201cmental rotation\u201d was examined. When the orientations of two identical or mirror figures are changed and then displayed, mental rotation is the phenomenon that the time taken to decide this difference is proportional to the angular difference between the orientations of the two figures. First, the reaction times when the presentations were in two and three dimensions were compared, and the effectiveness of the three\u2010dimensional presentation was studied. The result was that, even when displayed in three dimensions, a mental rotation similar to that of the two\u2010dimensional case was verified and the reaction time was significantly shortened. The result of studying the internal processes showed that three\u2010dimensional presentation was effective from the standpoint of the transformation to the internal representation. The subjects were divided into two groups based on their reaction times. When the effectiveness of the three\u2010dimensional presentation was studied, three\u2010dimensional presentation was particularly effective for the group with the short reaction times. Furthermore, when a part of the presentation figures were marked with color, the speed for rotating the representation became significantly faster regardless of the presentation dimension. By studying the subjects, we found colored marking was effective for subjects with long reaction times.

VThe effects of motion and stereopsis on three-dimensional visualization __ Previous studies have demonstrated that motion cues combined with stereoscopic viewing can enhance the perception of three-dimensional objects displayed on a two-dimensional computer screen. Using a variant of the mental rotation paradigm, subjects view pairs of object images presented on a computer terminal and judge whether the objects are the same or different. The effects of four variables on the accuracy and speed of decision performances are assessed: stereo vs. mono viewing, controlled vs. uncontrolled object motion, cube vs. sphere construction and wire frame vs. solid surface characteristic. Viewing the objects as three-dimensional images results in more accurate and faster decision performances. Furthermore, accuracy improves although response time increases when subjects control the object motion. Subjects are equally accurate comparing wire frame and solid images, although they take longer comparing wire frame images. The cube-based or sphere-based object construction has no impact on decision accuracy nor response time.

VMaintenance of the long-term effectiveness of tramadol in treatment of the pain of diabetic neuropathy __ Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tramadol in a 6-month open extension following a 6-week double-blind randomized trial. Research design and methods: Patients with painful diabetic neuropathy who completed the double-blind study were eligible for enrollment in an open extension of up to 6 months. All patients received tramadol 50\u2013400 mg/day. Self-administered pain intensity scores (scale 0\u20134; none to extreme pain) and pain relief scores (scale \u22121\u20134; worse to complete relief) were recorded the first day of the open extension (last day of the double-blind phase) and at 30, 90, and 180 days. Results: A total of 117 patients (56 former tramadol and 61 former placebo) entered the study. On the first day of the study, patients formerly treated with placebo had a significantly higher mean pain intensity score (2.2±1.02 vs. 1.4±0.93, P<0.001) and a lower pain relief score (0.9±1.43 vs. 2.2±1.27, P<0.001) than former tramadol patients. By Day 90, both groups had mean pain intensity scores of 1.4, which were maintained throughout the study. Mean pain relief scores (2.4±1.09 vs. 2.2±1.14) were similar after 30 days in the former placebo and former tramadol groups, respectively and were maintained for the duration of the study. Four patients discontinued therapy due to ineffective pain relief; 13 patients discontinued due to adverse events. The most common adverse events were constipation, nausea, and headache. Conclusions: Tramadol provides long-term relief of the pain of diabetic neuropathy.

VSome studies directed at increasing the potential use of palmyrah (Borassus flabellifer L) fruit pulp __ Attempts have been made to predict the most feasible end\u2010use for palmyrah fruit pulp (PFP), which is still largely regarded as a waste product. Correlation of end\u2010use with flabelliferin profile is logical but practically difficult, as it has been found that the morphology of the fruit and the colour of the pulp (carotenoid content) do not correlate with each other, and that neither has predictive value for the flabelliferin profile. It appears that some varieties of palmyrah are sweet and can be used for products such as jams and cordials. A few very bitter PFPs can be de\u2010bittered with a cheap commercial enzyme for similar uses. The majority of available PFP appears to be best used as an alcoholic fermentation base, with the possibility of using the carotenoids (by\u2010product) as a food colorant. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry

VPolycyclic aromatic compounds in cod ( Gadus morhua ) from the Northwest Atlantic and St. Lawrence Estuary __ There is limited information available on levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in major fish populations including populations from the Northwest Atlantic. The cod (Gadus morhua) stocks off eastern Canada form the basis of one of the world's most important fisheries. Muscle tissues of cod collected from Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) management Divisions 2J, 3K and 3Ps off Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as three contaminated sites in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were analyzed for total polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) by fluorimetry. Concentrations were determined in terms of crude oil and chrysene equivalents in line with recommendations of the International Oceanographic Commission. Overall, relatively low concentrations of PAC were found, the highest values generally being below 0.1 \u03bcg/g (dry weight) in terms of chrysene equivalents. Similarly, only trace levels of a few PAH were detected in composite samples analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It is of interest that the highest levels of PAC were found in fish from NAFO Division 3k, while concentrations in fish from the two contiguous zones, 2J and 3Ps, as well as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, were similar. Division 3K is a major fishing zone and it is important to determine if trawler fleets are important sources of hydrocarbons derived from fossil fuels, in this and similar fishing areas of the world's oceans.

VEgocentric mental rotation in Hungarian dyslexic children __ A mental rotation task was given to 27 dyslexic children (mean age 9 years, 2 months) and to 28 non\u2010dyslexic children (mean age 8 years, 8 months). Pictures of right and left hands were shown at angles of 0, 50, 90 and 180 degrees, and the subjects were required to indicate whether what was shown was a right hand or a left hand. It was found that, in this task, the dyslexics did not show the normal pattern of response times at different angles, and also, that they made more errors than the controls. It is argued that this result is compatible with hypothesis that, in typical cases of dyslexia, there is a malfunctioning in the posterior parietal area. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VEfficient Group Signatures from Bilinear Pairing __ Abstract: This paper presents two types of group signature schemes from bilinear pairings: the mini type and the improved type. The size of the group public keys and the length of the signatures in both schemes are constant. An on-line third party is introduced to help the schemes to realize the \u201cjoin\u201d of group members, the \u201copening\u201d of group signatures, and the immediate \u201crevocation\u201d of group membership. It is shown that the introduction of this party makes our schemes much more simple and efficient than the previous schemes of this kind. The mini group signature is in fact only a BLS short signature. Unfortunately, it has a drawback of key escrow. A dishonest group manager can forge any group signature at his will. To avoid this drawback, we put forward an improved scheme, which is also very simple and efficient, and satisfies all the security requirements of a group signature scheme.

VComparative Study of Meta-heuristics for Solving Flow Shop Scheduling Problem Under Fuzziness __ Abstract: In this paper we propose a hybrid method, combining heuristics and local search, to solve flow shop scheduling problems under uncertainty. This method is compared with a genetic algorithm from the literature, enhanced with three new multi-objective functions. Both single objective and multi-objective approaches are taken for two optimisation goals: minimisation of completion time and fulfilment of due date constraints. We present results for newly generated examples that illustrate the effectiveness of each method.

VEstrogen affects cognition in women with psychosis __ Estrogen has been reported to affect aspects of cognition and psychopathology in women, both normal and with psychosis. This study aimed to replicate and extend this research by investigating the effect of estrogen on cognition over the menstrual cycle in a group of normal women and women with psychosis. The sample consisted of 31 premenstrual normal control subjects, and 29 women with psychosis. Subjects were tested twice, 2 weeks apart on a number of cognitive tests. There was no difference in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale scores between the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Both groups of women performed better on the Revised Mental Rotation Test and Trails A during the follicular phase when estrogen levels were low. Contrary to expectation, during the luteal phase, when estrogen was high, the control subjects showed no significant improvement in performance on verbal articulatory\u2013motor tasks, and the women with psychosis performed significantly worse on the Purdue Pegboard. The unexpected adverse effect of high levels of estrogen on motor performance in the psychotic women was hypothesized to be related to their disease process.

VThe functional role of dorso-lateral premotor cortex during mental rotation. An event-related fMRI study separating cognitive processing steps using a novel task paradigm __ We examined whether body parts attached to abstract stimuli automatically force embodiment in a mental rotation task. In Experiment 1, standard cube combinations reflecting a human pose were added with (1) body parts on anatomically possible locations, (2) body parts on anatomically impossible locations, (3) colored end cubes, and (4) simple end cubes. Participants (N = 30) had to decide whether two simultaneously presented stimuli, rotated in the picture plane, were identical or not. They were fastest and made less errors in the possible-body condition, but were slowest and least accurate in the impossible-body condition. A second experiment (N = 32) replicated the results and ruled out that the poor performance in the impossible-body condition was due to the specific stimulus material. The findings of both experiments suggest that body parts automatically trigger embodiment, even when it is counterproductive and dramatically impairs performance, as in the impossible-body condition. It can furthermore be concluded that body parts cannot be used flexibly for spatial orientation in mental rotation tasks, compared to colored end cubes. Thus, embodiment appears to be a strong and inflexible mechanism that may, under certain conditions, even impede performance.

VOn Improving Spatial Ability Through Computer-Mediated Engineering Drawing Instruction __ This study investigates the effectiveness of computer-mediated Engineering Drawing instruction in improving spatial ability namely spatial visualisation and mental rotation. A multi factorial quasi experimental design study was employed involving a cohort of 138, 20 year old average undergraduates. Three interventional treatments were administered, namely Interactive Engineering Drawing Trainer (EDwgT), conventional instruction using printed materials enhanced with digital video clips, and conventional instruction using printed materials only. Using an experimental 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design, the research has found statistical significant improvements in spatial visualisation tasks. There appears to be no improvement in reaction times for Mental Rotation. The authors also have investigated the gender differences and the influence of prior experience of spatial ability.

VTraining in Mental Rotation and Spatial Visualization and Its Impact on Orthographic Drawing Performance __ This paper reports the findings from an experimental study based on the pretest posttest research design that studied mental rotation (MR) and spatial visualization (SV) training outcomes and their impact on orthographic drawing performance. The sample of the study comprised 98 secondary school students (36 girls, 62 boys, M age = 15.5 years, age range: 15 -16 years) who were randomly assigned into two experimental groups and a control group. The first experimental group trained in an interaction-enabled condition, the second experimental group trained in an animation-enhanced condition and the control group trained using printed materials. The research instruments used were computerized versions of the Mental Rotation and Spatial Visualization tests. Data were analyzed using a Statistical Package for Social Science, SPSS version 14.0. The results reveal a significant performance gain in spatial visualization and mental rotation accuracy, but not in mental rotation speed. The training method seems to be interlinked with SV, as the interaction-enabled group outperformed the other groups. In addition, technology based training methods seem more efficient, as both experimental groups performed better than the control group in MR accuracy. Moreover, gender was a significant variable, with boys attaining differential improvement gains, as opposed to girls. The group gaining higher SV through training performed better in solving an Orthographic Drawing task, indicating that the training method is related to the application of the received mental processes, in solving the task. Additionally, this particular finding implies that the cognitive process invoked in solving an orthographic drawing may share similar process associated with spatial visualization. Implications of the research findings are also discussed in this paper.

VCars or dolls? Influence of the stereotyped nature of the items on children's mental-rotation performance __ This study inquired the influence of stimulus features on children's mental-rotation performance with novel gender-stereotyped test versions (M-MRT and F-MRT) administered to 290 elementary-school children (147 second graders and 143 fourth graders; age: M = 8.87, SD = 1.09). No significant gender difference and no significant interaction of gender and stimulus type could be demonstrated. Multiple regression revealed that mental-rotation performance was predicted by perceptual speed and stimulus type (female or male stereotyped) but not by the perceived stereotyped nature or the perceived familiarity of the stimuli. As expected the objects used in the M-MRT were more familiar to boys than to girls, while the objects used in the F-MRT were more familiar to girls than to boys. Furthermore, the cube figures (based on Shepard & Metzler, 1971) were perceived as more male stereotyped. Overall, findings suggest that stimulus attributes influence mental-rotation performance. Results can be discussed with regard to the influence of the stimulus characteristics of Shepard and Metzler's cube figures on the large gender differences in tests in which these figures are used.

VMental rotation of letters and shapes in developmental dyslexia __ Extending the work of Corballis et al (1985, Cortex 21 225 ^ 236), we investigated mental rotation of letters (experiment 1), and of letters and shapes (experiment 2) in normal readers and developmental dyslexics. Whereas the overall response times were equal for shapes in both groups, for letters they were slower in dyslexics. For letters as well as for shapes, however, the same mental-rotation effects were obtained between the groups. The results are interpreted as support for the notion of developmental dyslexia as a deficit in functional coordination between graphemic and phonological letter representations.

VMENTAL ROTATION OF LETTERS, PICTURES, AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS IN GERMAN DYSLEXIC CHILDREN __ This study examines mental rotation ability in children with developmental dyslexia. Prior investigations have yielded equivocal results that might be due to differences in stimulus material and testing formats employed. Whereas some investigators found dyslexic readers to be impaired in mental rotation, others did not report any performance differences or even superior spatial performance for dyslexia. Here, we report a comparison of mental rotation for letters, three-dimensional figures sensu Shepard and Metzler, and colored pictures of animals or humans in second-grade German dyslexic readers. Findings indicate that dyslexic readers are impaired in mental rotation for all three kinds of stimuli. Effects of general intelligence were controlled. Furthermore, dyslexic children were deficient in other spatial abilities like identifying letters or forms among distracters. These results are discussed with respect to the hypotheses of a developmental dysfunction of the parietal cortex or a subtle anomaly in cerebellar function in dyslexic readers.

VManual and virtual rotation of a three-dimensional object. __ An orientation-matching task, based on a mental rotation paradigm, was used to investigate how participants manually rotated a Shepard-Metzler object in the real world and in an immersive virtual environment (VE). Participants performed manual rotation more quickly and efficiently than virtual rotation, but the general pattern of results was similar for both. The rate of rotation increased with the starting angle between the stimuli meaning that, in common with many motor tasks, an amplitude-based relationship such as P. M. Fitts' (1954) law is applicable. When rotation was inefficient (i.e., not by the shortest path), it was often because participants incorrectly perceived the orientation of one of the objects, and this happened more in the VE than in the real world. Thus, VEs allow objects to be manipulated naturally to a limited extent, indicating the need for timing-scale factors to be used for applications such as method-time-motion studies of manufacturing operations.

VRIGHT-LEFT ORIENTATION, MENTAL ROTATION, AND PERSPECTIVE-TAKING: WREN CAN CHILDREN IMAGINE WHAT PEOPLE SEE FROM THEIR OWN VIEWPOINT? __ Right-left orientation, mental rotation, and perspective-taking were examined in a group of 406 subjects ranging from 5 to 11 yr. of age with equal numbers of children in each age group. Immediate recognition was not a difficult task as even young children succeeded adequately on the three tasks involving different images. Right-left identification, where right and left terms are used, was harder even for the oldest subjects when associated with mental rotation. When children had to identify which image a person would see from another viewpoint, they succeeded when the person was looking away in the same direction as they were looking. When the person was facing the children (in the opposite direction or ''forward''), three different behaviours emerged which indicated absence or presence of mental rotation in perspective-taking. Young subjects chose images as if the figures in the image were seeing from the subject's viewpoint; this percentage diminished slowly across increased ages. As subjects' ages increased, more chose the correct image. Even at 11 years of age, however, only half of the subjects chose correctly. Finally, an equal percentage of subjects among the different age groups understood that the person was seeing a different orientation of the persons but did not associate this with the correct right-left position or the persons on the image. This transition most probably reflects the slow evolution of cognitive processes which determine the way the child will use references to internal or external frameworks. It illustrates as well the passage from egocentrism to geocentrism with the ability to consider viewpoints other than one's own.

VInduced EEG alpha oscillations are related to mental rotation ability: The evidence for neural efficiency and serial processing __ People with better skills in mental rotation require less time to decide about the identity of rotated images. In the present study, alphanumeric characters rotated in the frontal plane were employed to assess the relationship between rotation ability and EEG oscillatory activity. Response latency, a single valid index of performance in this task, was significantly associated with the amplitude of induced oscillations in the alpha (8\u201313 Hz) and the low beta band (14\u201320 Hz). In accordance with the neural efficiency hypothesis, less event-related desynchronization (ERD) was related to better (i.e. faster) task performance. The association between response time and ERD was observed earlier (\u223c600\u2013400 ms before the response) over the parietal cortex and later (\u223c400\u2013200 ms before the response) over the frontal cortex. Linear mixed-effect regression analysis confirmed that both early parietal and late frontal alpha/beta power provided significant contribution to prediction of response latency. The result indicates that two distinct serially engaged neurocognitive processes comparably contribute to mental rotation ability. In addition, we found that mental rotation-related negativity, a slow event-related potential recorded over the posterior cortex, was unrelated to the asymmetry of alpha amplitude modulation.

VMotor Area Activity During Mental Rotation Studied by Time-Resolved Single-Trial fMRI __ The functional equivalence of overt movements and dynamic imagery is of fundamental importance in neuroscience. Here, we investigated the participation of the neocortical motor areas in a classic task of dynamic imagery, Shepard and Metzler's mental rotation task, by time-resolved single-trial functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The subjects performed the mental-rotation task 16 times, each time with different object pairs. Functional images were acquired for each pair separately, and the onset times and widths of the activation peaks in each area of interest were compared to the response times. We found a bilateral involvement of the superior parietal lobule, lateral premotor area, and supplementary motor area in all subjects; we found, furthermore, that those areas likely participate in the very act of mental rotation. We also found an activation in the left primary motor cortex, which seemed to be associated with the right-hand button press at the end of the task period.

VAn event-related potentials study of mental rotation in identifying chemical structural formulas __ The purpose of this study was to investigate how mental rotation strategies affect the identification of chemical structural formulas. This study conducted event-related potentials (ERPs) experiments. In addition to the data collected in the ERPs, a Chemical Structure Conceptual Questionnaire and interviews were also administered for data collection. Eighteen university students majoring in chemistry were recruited. In the ERP experiments, the participants were required to identify 2D figures, 2D chemical structural formulas, 3D objects and 3D chemical structural formulas. The contours of 2D figures are similar to those of 2D chemical structural formulas, but they contain no content knowledge. Likewise, the contours of 3D objects are similar to 3D chemical structural formulas without content knowledge. The results showed that all students used similar strategies of mental rotation in identifying 2D figures, 3D objects and 3D chemical structural formulas. However, the high-achieving students used different strategies in identifying 2D figures and chemical structural formulas, while the low-achieving students tended to use similar strategies of mental rotation in identifying both 2D figures and chemical structural formulas. The results indicate that some of the difficulties in identifying 2D chemical structural formulas that students encounter are due to their inappropriate strategies of mental rotation.

VAntepartum management of the multiple gestation: The case for specialized care __ Multiple gestations are increasingly more common and represent one of the highest risk conditions faced in pregnancy. The population-attributable fetal and newborn risks of twin and triplet gestations are compelling. This article is dedicated to a discussion of the antepartum management of multiple gestations and a conclusion that specialized care can improve both perinatal morbidity and mortality in these pregnancies. Prenatal care for multiple gestations should be provided by an experienced and dedicated staff that can anticipate and manage the various and complex problems presented by the multifetal gestation. Specialized care for multiple gestations should include components such as consistent evaluation of maternal symptoms and cervical status by a single care-provider, intensive preterm birth prevention education, individualized modification of maternal activity, increased attention to nutrition, ultrasonography, tracking of clinic nonattenders, and a supportive clinical environment. This sort of specialization and individualization of antepartum care for multiple gestations provides the best opportunity to maximize intrauterine fetal growth, identify congenital anomalies, prevent extremely preterm or very low birth weight deliveries, and identify fetal or maternal complications that may necessitate more intensive fetal surveillance or even delivery to reduce adverse perinatal outcome.

VCommunity services in multiple sclerosis: still a matter of chance __ OBJECTIVES People with multiple sclerosis often have multiple complex needs that require input from a wide range of services. Many complain that services are inadequate and poorly coordinated. Few studies have been undertaken to support this contention and objective data are scarce. The level of services and home modifications received by people with multiple sclerosis across a broad range of disease severity has been investigated. METHODS As part of a quality of life study, 150 adults with clinically definite multiple sclerosis were interviewed, using a structured questionnaire, to determine their current use of outpatient and community services and the home modifications in place. Disability, handicap, and emotional status were also measured. RESULTS Forty five per cent of people did not receive any community services other than contact with their general practitioner. Thirty nine per cent of people with moderate and 12% with severe disability failed to receive community services. For the services received: 17% had contact with a community nurse; 33% with a care attendant or home help; 23% with a physiotherapist, 21% with an occupational therapist, and 10% with a social worker. Fifty eight per cent of people had modifications to their home as a direct result of multiple sclerosis. The relation between level of disability and number of services and adaptations received was moderate (r=0.58 and 0.54 respectively) and the relation between level of services and age (r=0.12), living alone (r=0.16), and emotional status (r=0.10) was negligible. CONCLUSIONS Despite a shift of emphasis from hospital to community care, and the establishment of standards of care for multiple sclerosis, many people with moderate or severe disability fail to receive assistance. These results provide evidence to support the dissatisfaction felt by people with multiple sclerosis in relation to the services they receive. It raises questions about equitable allocation of resources and highlights the urgent need for a review of community services.

VIs Mental Rotation Ability a Predictor of Success for Motor Performance? __ Previous studies provided evidence of a relationship between mental rotation (MR) and motor processes in children and adults. However, there is no direct evidence that MR ability is a reliable predictor of success for motor performance. After completion of a MR test, the motor performance of 7- to 8-year-old and 11- to 12-year-old children was measured along a steeple chase and an equivalent straight distance sprint. The chase involved several motor actions requiring, among different competencies, spatial abilities such as performing a forward roll, jumping, crawling, turning, and changing directions. Data revealed that the time taken to complete the chase was influenced by speed and sex, but also by the individual MR ability. Based on these findings, we assume that MR and motor performance may share similar subprocesses.

The polymers were characterized with1H,13C, and29Si NMR, UV, IR, GPC, TGA, and elemental analyses. UV absorption maxima of these polymers all show a red shift with increasing length of the polymer backbone, suggesting that conjugation occurs through the combined \u03c3-Si and \u03c0-thiophene backbone.

VDetection of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by means of the ionization method: Comparison with the UV\u2010fluorescence method and the chemiluminescence method __ Comparison measurements between the ionization gas analytical system (AIG\u20102) for detecting sulphur dioxide from ambient air and a monitor based on the UV\u2010fluorescence method were performed. The experiments included both laboratory tests at two laboratories with different calibration devices, and field periods in two different cities. According to the laboratory tests the reproducibility of the AIG\u20102 was within 7.5 per cent over two years. During the first measurements the response ratio of the monitors was 1.5 on average for both laboratory and field measurements. After maintenance the response ratio was nearly 1.0 in the laboratory measurements and 0.9 in the field measurements. The drift of the AIG\u20102 was 0.89 per cent per month. In addition to the comparison of monitors, the stability of the AIG\u20102 also facilitates the comparison of different calibration methods between two laboratories. A maximum difference of 15 per cent and a minimum difference of 2 per cent between the output of the calibration devices of the two laboratories was found. We also discovered that the sample matrices of different calibration devices are different (e.g. moisture, inhomogeneities, particles), which can cause problems even when the calibration concentration is the same. As an example of the versatility.

VAbnormalities of SNARE Mechanism Proteins in Anterior Frontal Cortex in Severe Mental Illness __ A fundamental molecular component of neural connectivity is the SNARE (SNAP receptor) protein complex, which consists of three proteins, syntaxin, SNAP-25 and VAMP. Under appropriate conditions, the SNARE complex can be formed in vitro. To investigate the hypothesis that dysregulation of SNARE proteins or their interactions could be abnormal in severe mental disorders, the three SNARE proteins and the complex were studied in post-mortem anterior frontal cortex homogenates. An ELISA was used to quantify SNARE protein immunoreactivities in cortical homogenates from four groups: patients with schizophrenia who died of causes other than suicide (n = 6), patients with schizophrenia and suicide (n = 7), patients with depression and suicide (n = 11), and controls (n = 11). Differences between groups in patterns of SNARE protein immuno-reactivities were demonstrated [Wilks' Lambda F(9,68) = 3.57, P = 0.001]. Protein-by-protein analyses indicated a significant reduction in SNAP-25 immunoreactivity in the schizophrenia non-suicide group [28% decrease relative to controls, F(3,31) = 6.45, P = 0.002, Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test, P < 0.01]. The intercorrelations between SNARE protein and synaptophysin immunoreactivities were high in controls, but lower in the other groups, further indicating disturbances in relationships between these proteins. The extent of SNARE complex formation in vitro was studied using immuno-blotting. Significant differences related to group membership were observed for the SNARE complexes identified by SNAP-25 [Wilks' Lambda F(3,31) = 4.76, P = 0.008] and by syntaxin immunostaining [Wilks' Lambda F(3,31) = 9.16, P = 0.0002]. In both groups with suicide as a cause of death, relatively more SNAP-25 and syntaxin was present in the heterotrimeric SNARE complex than in other molecular forms. These abnormalities in the SNARE complex could represent a molecular substrate for abnormalities of neural connectivity in severe mental disorders.

VAssociation of aromatase (TTTAn) repeat polymorphism length and the relationship between obesity and decreased sperm concentration __ BACKGROUND Obesity in men is associated with low sperm count, however, this finding is inconsistent. Here, we describe length of the short tandem repeat aromatase (CYP19A1) polymorphism and its relationship to increased weight and sperm count. METHODS A cohort of 215 men was recruited from the community and BMI, hormone levels and sperm parameters were determined at enrollment. Men (196) were genotyped for length of the tetranucleotide TTTA repeats polymorphism (TTTAn), defined as short (S 7 repeats) or long (L > 7 repeats). Genotypes were categorized using allele combinations as low repeats SS, or high repeats SL/LL. Weight and sperm parameters were examined in relation to size of TTTAn repeat. RESULTS Mean (SD) age was 29.8 8.6 years and mean BMI was 25.6 4.6 kg/m2. Men with high repeats had higher estradiol (E2) levels (98.0 33.36 pmol/l) than men with low repeats (85.9 26.61 pmol/l; P 0.026). Lower FSH levels tended to be present in men with high repeats versus men with low repeats (P 0.052). After stratification by genotype, a negative correlation between BMI and sperm count (Pearson's coefficient 0.406) was seen only among men with high repeats (P 0.019). Only men with high repeats exhibited increased E2 with increased weight. A decrease in testosterone: E2 ratio with increasing BMI was more pronounced in men with high versus low, repeats (R2 0.436 versus 0.281). CONCLUSIONS Higher TTTA repeat numbers (>7 repeats) in the aromatase gene are associated with a negative relationship between obesity and sperm count. The effect of obesity on E2 and sperm count appears to be absent in men with low (7) repeats.

VSpatial Ability, Navigation Strategy, and Geographic Knowledge Among Men and Women __ In a study of sex differences in navigation strategy and geographic knowledge, 90 men and 104 women completed cognitive spatial tests, gave directions from local maps, and identified places on a world map. On the spatial tests, men were better than women in mental rotation skill, but men and women were similar in object location memory. In giving directions, men were more abstract and Euclidian, using miles and north\u2013south\u2013east\u2013west terms, whereas women were more concrete and personal, using landmarks and left\u2013right terms. Older subjects of both sexes gave more abstract Euclidian directions than younger subjects did. On the world map, men identified more places than women did. The data fit a causal model in which sex predicts world map knowledge and the use of Euclidian directions, both directly and indirectly through a sex difference in spatial skills. The age effect, which was independent of sex, supports a developmental view of spatial cognition.

VDevelopment of a species-specific DNA probe for Mycoplasma capricolum __ A specific DNA probe for the detection and identification of Mycoplasma capricolum, one of the causative agents of contagious agalactia syndrome, was selected from a genomic library. It consists of a 900bp RsaI genomic fragment of M. capricolum (reference strain), cloned into the EcoRV site of the plasmid Bluescript.By using the appropriate stringency this radiolabelled probe reacts specifically with M. capricolum when tested by dot blot hybridization against various mycoplasmal DNAs. The current level of sensitivity of the 32P-labelled 900bp RsaI probe is 500 pg of homologous DNA, corresponding to 5×104 mycoplasmas.A non radioactive labelling method, using the digoxigenin-11-dUTP, was also tested. The specificity of the digoxigenin-labelled probe was equivalent to that obtained with the radioactive probe. However the sensitivity of detection decreased to 1 ng of homologous DNA detected, corresponding to 1×105 mycoplasmas.Tests performed with milk samples have demonstrated that the radioactive 900 bp RsaI probe indeed detected M. capricolum contained in milk. A positive signal was obtained when 105M. capricolum were present in the spot.

VThe combined diversification breadth and mode dimensions and the performance of large diversified firms __ This paper examines the impact of the symbiotic relationship between diversification breadth and mode on firm performance. Seventy\u2010three Fortune 500 firms were classified by diversification breadth (related/unrelated) and mode (internal/external) and their performance during the period 1975\u201384 analyzed on four financial performance measures. The two related categories (related\u2010internal/related\u2010external) were generally higher performers than the two unrelated categories (unrelated\u2010internal/unrelated\u2010external) as hypothesized, but the differences were not significant on most performance measures. The unrelated\u2010external category appears to be the worst performer, which presents a dilema since this strategy has dominated the conglomerate movement.

VMirror agnosia and mirror ataxia constitute different parietal lobe disorders __ We describe two new clinical syndromes, mirror agnosia and mirror ataxia, both characterized by the deficit of reaching for an object through a mirror in association with a lesion of either parietal lobe. Clinical investigation of 13 patients demonstrated that the impairments affected both sides of the body. In mirror agnosia, the patients always reached toward the virtual object in the mirror and they were not capable of changing their behavior even after presentation of the position of the object in real visual space. In mirror ataxia (resembling optic ataxia) although some patients initially tended to reach for the virtual object in the mirror, they soon learned to guide their arms toward the real object, all of them producing many directional errors. Both patient groups performed poorly on mental rotation, but only the patients with mirror agnosia were impaired in line orientation. Only 1 of the patients suffered from neglect and 3 from apraxia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that in mirror agnosia the common zone of lesion overlap was scattered around the posterior angular gyrus/superior temporal gyrus and in mirror ataxia around the postcentral sulcus. We propose that both these clinical syndromes may represent different types of dissociation of retinotopic space and body scheme, or likewise, of allocentric and egocentric space normally adjusted in the parietal lobe.

VEntero-Pouch Fistula: A Rare Complication of Right Colon Continent Urinary Diversion __ Purpose Entero-conduit fistulas have been reported in patients with ileal and jejunal conduit urinary diversions, and entero-pouch fistulas have been reported in those with Kock pouch and other ileal neobladders. We now report that entero-pouch fistula is a rare complication of continent urinary diversion using the right colon.Materials and Methods A review of the charts of 146 patients who had undergone right colon urinary diversion during the last 6 years revealed that entero-pouch fistula developed in 3. A total of 36 patients had had previous pelvic radiation, including the 3 with entero-pouch fistulas. Two patients presented with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and 1 presented with diarrhea and food particles in the urine. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was present in 2 of the patients and radiography of the pouch confirmed the diagnosis in all 3.Results Conservative therapy, which included a low residue diet and continuous drainage of the pouch, was successful in 2 of the 3 patients and surgical excision of the entero-pouch fistula was required in 1 since the fistula did not close after 12 weeks.Conclusions Although rare, an entero-pouch fistula should be suspected in patients who present with gastrointestinal symptoms and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis after right colon reservoir urinary diversion. Conservative therapy is recommended initially.

VThe role of instructions in the variability of sex-related differences in multiple-choice tests __ When both experts and lay people interpret data on sex-related differences, they usually forget that the instruments for data collection might be provoking such differences. This experiment, carried out on 240 participants, focused on the effects of four instruction/scoring conditions on sex effect size in two computerized tests \u2014 vocabulary and mental rotation, for which sex-related differences had been shown to be, respectively, small (favoring females) and large (favoring males). Given the caution which seems to characterize female performance, our general hypothesis predicted that, under instructions encouraging guessing, effect sizes favoring males would augment and effect sizes favoring females would diminish. The opposite results were expected under instructions discouraging guessing. Some supporting evidence was found.

VWithin\u2010tree vertical pattern in Bactrocera oleae Gmel. (Dipt, Tephritidae) infestations and optimization of insecticide applications __ The vertical pattern in olive fruit fly infestations was studied in the Tlemcen region (western part of Algeria) in 1990. The infestation rate of olives, measured by punctures, eggs, larvae, exit holes and pupae, was always higher in the lowest stratum (up to 2 m) than in the upper (3 m), the middle stratum being infested at an intermediate level. Differences were largest in October. In 1992 this result was used by spraying insecticide in an orchard half as intensely in the two higher strata as in the lower stratum. This led to relatively good protection in comparison with unsprayed orchard.

VMental rotation of random lined figures __ The present study investigated the possible occurrence of mental rotation in judgments of whether pairs of line figures were identical. The feasibility of two discrete cognitive explanations based on holistic transformation and on feature computation was examined with varied levels of complexity controlled by the numbers of lines in a figure. In the experiment, participants were required to judge whether simultaneously presented pairs of figures were the same or different. When the participants' data were collapsed for regression analyses, evidence for mental rotation was not detected at any level of complexity, but reanalysis of the data revealed that some participants employed mental rotation in the cognition of complex figures. A monotonous increase in reaction times as a function of the number of lines was evident in identical pairs of figures but not in nonidentical pairs. It is argued that the feature computation explanation would better account for these results than would the holistic transformation explanation.

VSeasonal change in anomalous WNPSH associated with the strong East Asian summer monsoon __ The most striking features observed in the strong East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) are the seasonal change in the anomalous western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) and the accompanying convective activities over the tropical Pacific and the Indian Ocean. The seasonal change in the anomalous WNPSH associated with the strong EASM has been studied through model experiments. The results of numerical experiments indicate that the anomalous WNPSH associated with the strong EASM has a strong seasonality with respect to its intensity and location. This is due to the difference between the contributions of the remote and local sea surface temperature forcings in the tropical Pacific and the Indian Ocean. It is also found that the air\u2010sea interactions over the tropical western Pacific and the Indian Ocean are essential to appropriately simulate the intensity and location of the anomalous WNPSH, which in turn modulate the East Asian summer monsoon rainfall during the summer of the strong EASM years.

VGender Differences in Spatial Ability of Young Children: The Effects of Training and Processing Strategies __ A sample of 116 children (M\u2003=\u20036\u2003years 7 months) in Grade 1 was randomly assigned to experimental (n\u2003=\u200360) and control (n\u2003=\u200356) groups, with equal numbers of boys and girls in each group. The experimental group received a program aimed at improving representation and transformation of visuospatial information, whereas the control group received a substitute program. All children were administered mental rotation tests before and after an intervention program and a Global\u2013Local Processing Strategies test before the intervention. The results revealed that initial gender differences in spatial ability disappeared following treatment in the experimental but not in the control group. Gender differences were moderated by strategies used to process visuospatial information. Intervention and processing strategies were essential in reducing gender differences in spatial abilities.

VDifferential Misclassification Arising from Nondifferential Errors in Exposure Measurement __ Misclassification into exposure categories formed from a continuous variable arises from measurement error in the continuous variable. Examples and mathematical results are presented to show that if the measurement error is nondifferential (independent of disease status), the resulting misclassification will often be differential, even in cohort studies. The degree and direction of differential misclassification vary with the exposure distribution, the category definitions, the measurement error distribution, and the exposure\u2013disease relation.Failure to recognize the likelihood of differential misclassification may lead to incorrect conclusions about the effects of measurement error on estimates of relative risk when categories are formed from continuous variables, such as dietary intake. Simulations were used to examine some effects of nondifferential measurement error. Under the conditions used, nondifferential measurement error reduced relative risk estimates, but not to the degree predicted by the assumption of nondifferential misclassification. When relative risk estimates were corrected using methods appropriate for nondifferential misclassification, the \u2018corrected\u2019 relative risks were almost always higher than the true relative risks, sometimes considerably higher. The greater the measurement error, the more inaccurate was the correction. The effects of exposure measurement errors need more critical evaluation.Am J Epidemiol 1991 ;134:1233\u201344.

VStructural characterization of the molten globule and native states of ovalbumin: A H NMR study __ Molecular characteristics of ovalbumin (OVA) in the acidic (pD 3.08, the E\u2010form) and neutral [pD 7.29, the N\u2010form (native form)]. regions were studied by measuring effective radii, H NMR spectra, spin\u2010echo H NMR spectra and cross\u2010relaxation times (TIS) from irradiated to observed protein protons which are particularly sensitive for detection of the mobile segments and/or structural looseness in proteins. H NMR spectra did not show significant differences between the N\u2010 and E\u2010forms except for the spectral lines in the CH3, °CH2 and aromatic regions. Effective radii and TIS values for main\u2010 and side\u2010chains showed 1.08 and 1.5\u2010 to 2.0\u2010fold increases on going from the N\u2010 to E\u2010forms, respectively. The elongation of TIS values might indicate the appearance of the fluctuating tertiary structure in the E\u2010form. Molecular characteristics of the E\u2010form, inferred from reported far ultraviolet\u2010circular dichroism (UV\u2010CD) spectra in the peptide region, near UV\u2010CD spectra in the aromatic region [Koseki et al. (1988) J. Biochem.103, 425\u2010130]., effective radii and especially elongation of TIS values might indicate that the E\u2010form could be in the molten globule state. The onset of denaturation of OVA using I is measurements was also studied.

VPractising mental rotation using interactive Desktop Mental Rotation Trainer (iDeMRT) __ An experimental study involving 30 undergraduates (mean age\u2003=\u200320.5 years) in mental rotation (MR) training was conducted in an interactive Desktop Mental Rotation Trainer (iDeMRT). Stratified random sampling assigned students into one experimental group and one control group. The former trained in iDeMRT and the latter trained in conventional condition. A multifactorial pretest posttest design procedure was used and data were analysed using two\u2010way analysis of covariance. Overall, there was substantial improvement in MR accuracy. Main effects of training and gender were observed, indicating that iDeMRT group and boys outperformed the control group and girls respectively. In addition, an interaction between training method and gender was present, indicating that boys were more accurate when trained in iDeMRT and performed moderately in conventional method. Female participants achieved equivalent improvement gain in MR accuracy regardless of the training conditions used. For the speed measure of MR, no appreciable improvement was observed after training.

VRegulation of immunologic homeostasis in peripheral tissues by dendritic cells: The respiratory tract as a paradigm __ Dendritic cells are now recognized as the gatekeepers of the immune response, possessing a unique potential for acquisition of antigens at extremely low exposure levels and for efficient presentation of these in an immunogenic form to the naive T-cell system. Dendritic cell populations throughout the body exhibit a wide range of features in common that are associated with their primary functions, and these are considered in the initial section of this review. In addition, it is becoming evident that the properties and functions of these cells are refined by microenvironmental factors unique to their tissues of residence, a prime example being mucosal microenvironments such as those in respiratory tract tissues, and the latter represents the focus of the second section of this review.

VTime-domain computations of one-dimensional elastic waves in liquids, solids and ferroelectric ceramics __ Computational solutions of linear-elastic wave equations are usually executed with frequency-domain algorithms; however, time-domain methods offer significant advantages in speed and simplicity. In this work, a time-domain algorithm is developed for one-dimensional problems in rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. The result is simultaneously a finite-difference and method-of-characteristics algorithm. For most materials, the algorithm is explicit \u2014 for a given time, the solution at a particular position depends only upon solutions at earlier times. The exceptions are the ferroelectric ceramics which are an important class of electromechanical transducers. For these materials, the algorithm is implicit \u2014 for a given time, the solution at a particular position within the ceramic depends not only upon solutions at earlier times but also upon the current solutions at all other positions within the ceramic. Application of the algorithm is demonstrated for a variety of problems. Solutions are compared to the conventional finite-difference method, the conventional method of characteristics, and the Laplace transform method. Practical applications include the analysis of a lithotripter tool for fragmenting human kidney stones, and an acoustic logging tool for measuring the diameter and thickness of well casing.

VImplementation of a community liaison pharmacy service: a randomised controlled trial __ Objective The aim of this study was to provide a pharmacy service to improve continuity of patient care across the primary\u2010secondary care interface. Setting The study involved patients discharged from two acute\u2010care tertiary teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, returning to independent living. Methods Consecutive patients admitted to both hospitals who met the study criteria and provided consent were recruited. Recruited patients were randomised to receive either standard care (discharge counselling, provision of compliance aids and communication with primary healthcare providers when necessary) or the intervention (standard care and a home visit from a community liaison pharmacist (CLP) within 5 days of discharge). Participant medication was reviewed during the visit according to set protocols and compliance and medication understanding was measured. All participants were telephoned 8\u201312weeks after discharge to assess the impact of the intervention on adherence and medication knowledge. Key findings The CLP visited 142 patients with a mean time of 4.2 days following hospital discharge (range = 1\u201314 days). Consultations lasted 15\u2013105 min (mean, 49 min; SD, ± 21 min). The CLPs retrospectively coded 766 activities and interventions that occurred during home visits, subsequently categorised into three groups: counselling and education, therapeutic interventions and other interventions. No statistical difference was detected in the number of medications patients reported taking at follow\u2010up: the mean value was 7.72 (SD, ± 3.27) for intervention patients and 7.55 (SD, ± 3.27) for standard\u2010care patients (P = 0.662). At follow\u2010up self\u2010perceived medication understanding was found to have improved in intervention patients (P < 0.001) and significant improvements from baseline in medication adherence were found in both standard\u2010care (P < 0.022) and intervention (P < 0.005) groups; however, adherence had improved more in intervention patients. Conclusion The community liaison pharmacy service provided critical and useful interventions and support to patients, minimising the risk of medication misadventure when patients were discharged from hospital to home.

VYoung children's understanding of the mind: Imagery, introspection, and some implications __ This article summarizes a program of research demonstrating that early in the pre-school years children already have both a basic understanding of the ontological distinction between the mind and the external world and some capacity for introspection. Three-year-olds understand that mental phenomena such as visual images are subjective and immaterial. They can also engage in a rudimentary form of introspection, as shown by their ability to reflect on and discuss mental images. By 5 years of age, some children not only spontaneously use mental rotation on a mental-rotation task, but they also are conscious of this mental process. These findings sharply contrast with traditional accounts of development, in which such accomplishments were believed to occur only much later. This research supports both a more positive view of young children's understanding of the mind and a greater emphasis on metacognition in early childhood education.

VNeuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza viruses __ Zanamivir and oseltamivir, the currentlymarketed influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), are prescribed for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and are being stockpiled for pandemic influenza. Oseltamivir resistance has been reported in up to 2% of patients in clinical trials of oseltamivir and in up to 18% of treated children. There are also reports in at least three patients treated with oseltamivir for influenza A (H5N1) infections. At this stage, there are no reports of resistance occurring to zanamivir in immunocompetent patients. Zanamivir and oseltamivir bind differently at the neuraminidase catalytic site and this contributes to different drug resistance profiles. The magnitude and duration of NAI concentrations at the site of infection are also expected to be important factors and are determined by route and timing of drug administration, dose, and pharmacokinetic differences between patients. In addition, the type, strain, and virulence of the influenza strain and the nature of the immune response all appear to play a role in determining the likelihood of drug resistance arising. The clinical significance of a particular NAI\u2010resistant isolate from a patient is often not clear but virus viability and transmissibility are clearly important characteristics. Early initiation of NAI treatment in suspected cases of influenza is important for maximizing efficacy and minimizing the risk of drug resistance. Higher NAI doses and longer periods of treatment may be required for patients with influenza A (H5N1) infections but further work is needed in this area. J. Med.

VMolecular reorientation in the adsorption of some C i E j at the water-air interface __ As demonstrated by some recent works the adsorption properties of some n-alkyl poly-oxyethylene glycol ethers can be explained by a model assuming the co-existence of different orientation states for the adsorbed molecules. In the present paper, with the aim of giving complete evidence of the above, the adsorption isotherms and the adsorption kinetics of some n-decyl and dodecyl poly-oxytheylene glycol ethers (C10E8, C10E5, C10E4, C12E5, C12E8) at water/air interface have been studied by using the pendant drop technique. The data have been interpreted with a model considering the possibility of two orientation states for adsorbed molecules. The results of this study show that the model accurately describes both the equilibrium and dynamic adsorption behaviour of these molecules and that adsorption at water/air is controlled by diffusion. Moreover, the analysis of the best fit isotherm parameters of homologue molecules gives interesting information about the configuration of the adsorption layer.

VLong-term prospective assessment of left ventricular thrombus in anterior wall acute myocardial infarction and implications for a rational approach to embolic risk __ To prospectively assess the predictive value of left ventricular (LV) thrombus anatomy for defining the embolic risk after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 2 comparable groups of patients with a first anterior AMI (group A, 97 thrombolysed patients; group B, 125 patients untreated with antithrombotic drugs [total 222]) underwent prospective serial echocardiography (follow-up 39 ±13 months) at different time periods. LV thrombi were detected in 26 patients in group A (27%) and in 71 in group B (57%; p <0.005). Embolism occurred in 12 patients (5.4%; 1 in group A [1%] vs 11% in group B [9%], p < 0.04). At multivariate analysis, thrombus morphologic changes were the most powerful predictor of embolism (p <0.001), followed by protruding shape (p <0.01) and mobility (p <0.02). In patients untreated with thrombolysis, a higher occurrence of thrombus morphologic changes (48% vs 8%, p <0.002) and protruding shape (69% vs 31%, p <0.002) were observed, whereas thrombus mobility was similar in the 2 groups (18% vs 8%, p = NS). Thrombus resolution occurred more frequently in thrombolysed patients (85% vs 56%, p <0.002). Thus, after anterior AMI, changes in LV thrombus anatomy frequently occur and appear the most powerful predictor of embolization. A minor prevalence of thrombus, a more favorable thrombus anatomy, and a higher resolution rate may contribute to reduce embolic risk after thrombolysis.

VSome interesting structural chemistry of lithium __ The lithium salt of \u03b1-carboline, Li carb, (for which the systematic name is 1H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole), has been prepared and crystallized from both tetrahydrofuran and toluene. In each case the molecule is tetranuclear, with a distorted tetrahedron of lithium atoms, and in each case, the ligands are arranged in a Li4(carb)4 assembly having S4 point symmetry. In the compound crystallized from tetrahydrofuran, each lithium atom is coordinated by three nitrogen atoms and an oxygen atom, whereas in the compound obtained from toluene each lithium atom is only three-coordinate. The structures are topologically the same, but differ in the spatial orientations of the carboline planes.

VSimilarities between explicit and implicit motor imagery in mental rotation of hands: An EEG study __ Chronometric and imaging studies have shown that motor imagery is used implicitly during mental rotation tasks in which subjects for example judge the laterality of human hand pictures at various orientations. Since explicit motor imagery is known to activate the sensorimotor areas of the cortex, mental rotation is expected to do similar if it involves a form of motor imagery. So far, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have been used to study mental rotation and less attention has been paid to an established method for studying explicit motor imagery. Although hand mental rotation is claimed to involve motor imagery, the time-frequency characteristics of mental rotation have never been compared with those of explicit motor imagery. In this study, time-frequency responses of EEG recorded during explicit motor imagery and during a mental rotation task, inducing implicit motor imagery, were compared. Fifteen right-handed healthy volunteers performed motor imagery of hands in one condition and hand laterality judgement tasks in another while EEG of the whole head was recorded. The hand laterality judgement was the mental rotation task used to induce implicit motor imagery. The time-frequency analysis and sLORETA localisation of the EEG showed that the activities in the sensorimotor areas had similar spatial and time-frequency characteristics in explicit motor imagery and implicit motor imagery conditions. Furthermore this sensorimotor activity was different for the left and for the right hand in both explicit and implicit motor imagery. This result supports that motor imagery is used during mental rotation and that it can be detected and studied with EEG technology. This result should encourage the use of mental rotation of body parts in rehabilitation programmes in a similar manner as motor imagery.

VSex differences in mental rotation and spatial rotation in a virtual environment __ The visuospatial ability referred to as mental rotation has been shown to produce one of the largest and most consistent sex differences, in favor of males, in the cognitive literature. The current study utilizes both a paper-and-pencil version of the mental rotations test (MRT) and a virtual environment for investigating rotational ability among 44 adult subjects. Results replicate sex differences traditionally seen on paper-and-pencil measures, while no sex effects were observed in the virtual environment. These findings are discussed in terms of task demands and motor involvement. Sex differences were also seen in the patterns of correlations between rotation tasks and other neuropsychological measures. Current results suggest men may rely more on left hemisphere processing than women when engaged in rotational tasks.

VTwo- vs. three-dimensional presentation of mental rotation tasks: Sex differences and effects of training on performance and brain activation __ The well-documented sex difference in mental rotation favoring males has been shown to emerge only for 2-dimensional presentations of 3-dimensional objects, but not with actual 3-dimensional objects or with virtual reality presentations of 3-dimensional objects. Training studies using computer games with mental rotation-related content have demonstrated training effects on mental rotation performance. Here, we studied the combined effect of a two-week mental rotation (MR) training on 2-dimensional vs. 3-dimensional presentations of a classic Shepard\u2013Metzler task (presented in a pretest\u2013training\u2013posttest design) and their accompanying cortical activation patterns assessed via EEG in a sample of 38 male and 39 female adolescents of about 15 years of age. Analysis of one performance parameter (reaction times) displayed only main effects of dimensionality (with shorter RTs on the 3D vs. 2D version of the MR task) and of training (significant shortening of RTs), but no significant sex difference. Analysis of the other performance parameter (scores) in the MR task revealed a sex difference favoring males that first, appeared only in the 2D version, but not in the 3D version of the MR task and, secondly, diminished after training. Neurophysiologically we observed a complex sex × dimensionality × training × hemisphere interaction showing that the hypothesized decrease of brain activation (increase in neural efficiency) with training emerged for males in both 2D and 3D conditions, whereas for females this decrease was found only in the 3D but not with the 2D version of the MR task.

VTracking and Inferring Spatial Rotation by Children and Great Apes __ Finding hidden objects in space is a fundamental ability that has received considerable research attention from both a developmental and a comparative perspective. Tracking the rotational displacements of containers and hidden objects is a particularly challenging task. This study investigated the ability of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children and great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) to (a) visually track rotational displacements of a baited container on a platform and (b) infer its displacements by using the changes of position or orientation of 3 landmarks: an object on a container, the color of the containers, and the color of the platform on which the containers rested. Great apes and 5-year-old and older children successfully tracked visible rotations, but only children were able to infer the location of a correct cup (with the help of landmarks) after invisible rotations. The ability to use landmarks changed with age so that younger children solved this task only with the most explicit marker on the baited container, whereas older children, particularly 9-year-olds, were able to use landmark orientation to infer correct locations.

VVisuomotor mental rotation: Reaction time is determined by the complexity of the sensorimotor transformations mediating the response __ In the visuomotor mental rotation (VMR) task, participants point to a location that deviates from a visual target by a predetermined angle. A seminal investigation of the VMR task reported a linear increase in reaction time (RT) as a function of increasing angle, for 5°, 10°, 15°, 35°, 70°, 105°, and 140° (Georgopoulos and Massey, 1987). This finding led to the development of the mental rotation model (MRM) and the assertion that response preparation is mediated via the imagined rotation of a movement vector. To determine if the MRM can be extrapolated to perceptually familiar angles (e.g., 90° and 180°) within a range of equally spaced angles, we evaluated two independent sets of angles: 5°, 10°, 15°, 35°, 70°, 105°, and 140° (experiment one) and 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, 180°, and 210° (experiment two). Consistent with the MRM, experiment one revealed a linear increase in RT as a function of increasing angle; however, a non-linear relation was revealed for experimenttwo. RTs were fastest for 180°, followed by 30°, 90°, 60°, 150°, 210°, and 120°. Such results demonstrate that response preparation was not uniquely mediated via a mental rotation process. Instead, the present work provides evidence of a temporally demanding and cognitively mediated response substitution process, wherein the computational demands of response preparation are determined by the complexity of the sensorimotor transformations mediating the response.

VGender differences in pre-adolescents' mental-rotation performance: Do they depend on grade and stimulus type? __ In psychometric mental-rotation tasks, adult male participants usually outperform females. A large body of evidence suggests that this effect is reliable, quite stable over lifespan and one of the largest cognitive gender differences. However, there are controversial findings regarding the age in which the male advantage emerges. The present study aimed at contributing to a systematic developmental research of mental rotation by examining two grades and three stimulus types in order to determine how these variables influence the gender difference. Second and fourth graders (n = 432) were tested with a paper\u2013pencil mental-rotation task in three stimulus conditions (animal pictures, letters, cube figures). Whereas fourth graders showed a small, but significant, stimulus-independent gender difference favoring males, there was no effect of gender on the mental-rotation performance of second graders. Fourth-grade boys performed better than second-grade boys in all stimulus conditions. Fourth-grade girls, in contrast, outperformed second-grade girls in the animal pictures condition and the letters condition, but not in the cube-figures condition. Results are discussed with regard to implications for causal mechanisms underlying the gender difference in mental rotation.

VImmediate Beneficial Effects of Mental Rotation Using Foot Stimuli on Upright Postural Stability in Healthy Participants __ The present study was designed to investigate whether an intervention during which participants were involved in mental rotation (MR) of a foot stimulus would have immediate beneficial effects on postural stability (Experiment 1) and to confirm whether it was the involvement of MR of the foot, rather than simply viewing foot stimuli, that could improve postural stability (Experiment 2). Two different groups of participants ( in each group) performed MR intervention of foot stimuli in each of the two experiments. Pre- and postmeasurements of postural stability during unipedal and bipedal standing were made using a force plate for the intervention. Consistently, postural sway values for unipedal standing, but not for bipedal standing, were decreased immediately after the MR intervention using the foot stimuli. Such beneficial effects were not observed after the MR intervention using car stimuli (Experiment 1) or when participants observed the same foot stimuli during a simple reaction task (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that the MR intervention using the foot stimuli could contribute to improving postural stability, at least when it was measured immediately after the intervention, under a challenging standing condition (i.e., unipedal standing).

VRepresentations of Shape during Mental Rotation. __ How is shape represented during spatial tasks such as mental rotation? This research investigated the format of mental representations of 3-D shapes during mental rotation. Specifically, we tested the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation using methods ranging from reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eyetracking. Another set of studies examined whether people use piecemeal or holistic strategies to rotate complex objects. Results show that individuals with good rotation ability do not represent color during mental rotation and rotate whole shapes; whereas poor rotators do represent color and rotate individual pieces of the shape using piecemeal strategies. This work contributes to theories about cognitive shape processing by showing that different information processing strategies may be one cause of individual differences in mentally rotation performance. © 2010, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

VThe difference between flipping strategy and spinning strategy in mental rotation __ Murray (1997 Memory & Cognition 25 96\u2013105) showed that, when an inverted object was mentally rotated to upright, the reaction time (RT) of flipping strategy (rotating in depth about the horizontal axis) was shorter than that of spinning strategy (rotating in the picture plane). We hypothesised the absence of representation at the intermediate position between the inverted and the upright representations in the flipping strategy, and investigated this hypothesis by a priming paradigm that included prime and probe tasks within one trial. In the prime task, participants were asked to mentally rotate an inverted object to upright. In the probe task, they were asked to judge whether two objects simultaneously presented were the same or different. The flipping strategy in the prime task did not prime the probe task, whereas the spinning strategy did. The present results suggest that there is no intermediate representation in the flipping strategy: the difference in RT between the flipping strategy and the spinning strategy may be attributed to whether there is an intermediate representation or not, which could explain why depth rotation is faster.

VSex differences in mental rotation and spatial visualization ability: Can they be accounted for by differences in working memory capacity? __ Sex differences in spatial ability are well documented, but poorly understood. In order to see whether working memory is an important factor in these differences, 50 males and 50 females performed tests of three-dimensional mental rotation and spatial visualization, along with tests of spatial and verbal working memory. Substantial differences were found on all spatial ability and spatial working memory tests (that included both a spatial and verbal processing component). No significant differences were found in spatial short-term memory or verbal working memory. In addition, spatial working memory completely mediated the relationship between sex and spatial ability, but there was also a direct effect of sex on the unique variance in three-dimensional rotation ability, and this effect was not mediated by spatial working memory. Results are discussed in the context of research on working memory and intelligence in general, and sex differences in spatial ability more specifically.

VMental rotation of objects retrieved from memory: An fMRI study of spatial processing __ This functional MRI study examined how people mentally rotate a 3-dimensional object (an alarm clock) that is retrieved from memory and rotated according to a sequence of auditory instructions. We manipulated the geometric properties of the rotation, such as having successive rotation steps around a single axis versus alternating between 2 axes. The latter condition produced much more activation in several areas. Also, the activation in several areas increased with the number of rotation steps. During successive rotations around a single axis, the activation was similar for rotations in the picture plane and rotations in depth. The parietal (but not extrastriate) activation was similar to mental rotation of a visually presented object. The findings indicate that a large-scale cortical network computes different types of spatial information by dynamically drawing on each of its components to a differential, situation-specific degree.

VEmbodied mental rotation: a special link between egocentric transformation and the bodily self __ This experiment investigated the influence of motor expertise on object-based versus egocentric transformations in a chronometric mental rotation task using images of either the own or another person's body as stimulus material. According to the embodied cognition viewpoint, we hypothesized motor-experts to outperform non-motor experts specifically in the egocentric condition because of higher kinesthetic representation and motor simulations compared to object-based transformations. In line with this, we expected that images of the own body are solved faster than another person's body stimuli. Results showed a benefit of motor expertise and representations of another person's body, but only for the object-based transformation task. That is, this other-advantage diminishes in egocentric transformations. Since motor experts did not show any specific expertise in rotational movements, we concluded that using human bodies as stimulus material elicits embodied spatial transformations, which facilitates performance exclusively for egocentric transformations. Regarding stimulus material, the other-advantage ascribed to increased self-awareness-consciousness distracting attention-demanding resources, disappeared in the egocentric condition. This result may be due to the stronger link between the bodily self and motor representations compared to that emerging in object-based transformations.

VCortical Activations during the Mental Rotation of Different Visual Objects __ Whole-head functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to nine healthy right-handed subjects while they were performing three different mental rotation tasks and two visual control tasks. The mental rotation tasks comprised stimuli pairs derived from the 'classical' 3D cube figures first used by R. N. Shepard and J. Metzler (1971, Science 171, 701-703), pairs of letters, and pairs of abstract figures developed by J. Hochberg and L. Gellmann (1977, Memory Cognit. 5, 23-26). In some cases, the paired objects were identical except that they were rotated in a certain plane. In other cases, the two objects were incongruent. Subjects were shown one pair of objects at a time and asked to judge whether the two were the same. In line with previous studies we found that decision times increased linearly with the degree of separation between the two objects. Cortical activation converged to demonstrate bilateral core regions in the superior and inferior parietal lobe (centered on the intraparietal sulcus), which were similarly activated during all three mental rotation tasks. Thus, our results suggest that different kinds of stimuli used for mental rotation tasks did not inevitably evoke activations outside the parietal core regions. For example we did not find any activation in brain areas known to be involved in lexical or verbal processing nor activations in cortical regions known to be involved in object identification or classification.

VCognitive Coordinate Systems: Accounts of Mental Rotation and Individual Differences in Spatial Ability __ Strategic differences in spatial tasks can be explained in terms of different cognitive coordinate systems that subjects adopt. The strategy of mental rotation that occurs in many recent experiments uses a coordinate system denned by the standard axes of our visual world (i. e., horizontal, vertical, and depth axes). Several other possible coordinate systems (and hence other strategies) for solving the problems that occur in psychometric tests of spatial ability are examined in this article. One alternative strategy uses a coordinate system denned by the demands of each test item, resulting in mental rotation around arbitrary, taskdefined axes. Another strategy uses a coordinate system denned exclusively by the objects, producing representations that are invariant with the objects ' orientation. A detailed theoretical account of the mental rotation of individuals of low and high spatial ability, solving problems taken from psychometric tests, is instantiated as two related computer simulation models whose performance corresponds to the response latencies, eye-fixation patterns, and retrospective strategy reports of the two ability groups. The main purpose of this article is to provide a theory of how people solve problems on psychometric tests of spatial ability, focusing on the mental operations, representations, and strategies that are used for different types of problems. The theory is instantiated in terms of computer simulation models whose performance characteristics resemble human characteristics. A second purpose of the article is to analyze the processing differences between people of high and low spatial ability. One computer model simulates the processes

VThe structure of human intelligence: It is verbal, perceptual, and image rotation (VPR), not fluid and crystallized __ In a heterogeneous sample of 436 adult individuals who completed 42 mental ability tests, we evaluated the relative statistical performance of three major psychometric models of human intelligence-the Cattell-Horn fluid-crystallized model, Vernon\u2019s verbal\u2013perceptual model, and Carroll\u2019s three-strata model. The verbal-perceptual model fit significantly better than the other two. We improved it by adding memory and higher-order image rotation factors. The results provide evidence for a four-stratum model with a g factor and three third-stratum factors. The model is consistent with the idea of coordination of function across brain regions and with the known importance of brain laterality in intellectual performance. We argue that this model is theoretically superior to the fluid-crystallized model and highlight the importance of image rotation in human intellectual function.

VMental Object Rotation and Egocentric Body Transformation: Two Dissociable Processes? __ An important question in studies on mental rotation is whether the mental object rotation and the egocentric body transformation rely on dissociable mechanisms. We tested non-dancers and professional dancers as experts in the mental object rotation task (MORT, 3D-cubes used by Shepard & Metzler, 1971) and the mental body transformation task (MBRT, line drawings of human bodies similar to those used by Parsons, 1987). The cubes and body figures were presented in exactly the same rotation conditions; in the picture plane, 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°, and in combination with a rotation in depth, 0° (the stimuli are rotated in the picture plane only) and 180°. We could replicate the linear increase in RT with increasing angle for the cubes whereas the RT for rotated body figures increased for not depth-rotated bodies only (back view). Though, the RTs for inverted body figures were faster when they were rotated in depth (front view) compared to when they were rotated in the picture plane only back view). This finding suggests that participants use different strategies epending on the perceived orientation of the stimulus. The results indicate mpaired performance in the MORT for the experts.

VImpairments of mental rotation in Parkinson's disease __ It is controversial whether parkinsonian patients are impaired on visuospatial tasks. In the present study, patients and normal control subjects judged whether pairs of wire-frame figures in different orientations were the same or different. The orientation difference between the figures was either in the picture plane (around the z-axis, or two-dimensional) or in depth (around the y-axis, or three-dimensional). Reaction times and error rates were measured. For the two-dimensional task, there were no significant differences in errors between the two groups, though Parkinsonian subjects were significantly slower to respond than the control group. In the three-dimensional task, patients had a different pattern of reaction times from the controls and made significantly more errors, which were systematic at large angular differences. The results suggest a visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease, which reflects problems in some aspect of the perception of extra-personal space.

VGroup parent training: Is it effective for children of all ages? __ Archival data from 304 mothers who attended group parent training were used to test for age effects on statistical and clinical significance of improvements in child behavior problems following participation in the program. The Total Problem T score from the Child Behavior Checklist served as the dependent measure for all analyses. Results indicated that, for the total sample, the severity of problem behaviors before treatment was the best predictor of treatment outcomes. When the sample was divided into age groups, older children had more severe behavior problems before treatment, but all groups improved. When outcomes were examined for clinically significant improvements, adolescents had the lowest rate of clinical recovery, but the only significant predictor of treatment effects was again the severity of behavior problems before treatment. In general, the data supported the null hypothesis that group parent training is effective for children from early childhood through adolescence. However, positive group parent training outcome for families with children of any age was best predicted by the seriousness of the child's behavior problems prior to treatment.

VPalaeoenvironments and taphonomic preservation of dinosaur bone-bearing deposits in the Lower Cretaceous Hasandong Formation, Korea __ Dinosaur (mostly sauropod) bone-bearing deposits of the Lower Cretaceous Hasandong Formation of the Gyeongsang Supergroup, Korea, were examined for context, bone mineralogy, geochemistry, and clay mineralogy of palaeosols, and for palaeoenvironmental and preservational interpretation. Most of the Hasandong dinosaur remains are in proximal to distal floodplain deposits. Dinosaur bones commonly occur as fragments, except at the Galsari locality where partially articulated cervical vertebrae, a dorsal vertebra, a dorsal rib, and a caudal rib are associated. It is characteristic that the Hasandong bone-bearing deposits are preserved as calcic and vertic palaeosols, and that the bone fragments are thus commonly encrusted by micrite to form nodules. The bones are composed of well-crystallized francolite. Illite is the most abundant clay mineral. Relatively low87Sr/86Sr ratios of the dinosaur bones and acid-leachable fractions of the host rocks suggest that both the bones and leachable fractions were derived from a low87Sr/86Sr source such as contemporaneous volcanics. Early Cretaceous sauropods of the Korean peninsula inhabited dry woodlands with oxidized soils. The carcasses lay on floodplains and were scavenged by carnivores and carrion beetles, and severely weathered before burial. Volcanic activity near the basin sometimes resulted in rapid burial of unweathered bones on distal floodplains as in the Galsari bone deposits. After burial, the bone deposits experienced calcareous pedogenesis, which assisted preservation. The predominance of bone deposits in the Hasandong Formation may be attributable to the abundance of calcic palaeosols.

VThe effects of age and sex on mental rotation performance, verbal performance, and brain electrical activity __ This study examined the effects of age and sex on mental rotation performance, verbal performance, and brain\u2010wave activity. Thirty\u2010two 8\u2010year\u2010olds (16 boys) and 32 college students (16 men) had EEG recorded at baseline and while performing four computerized tasks: a two\u2010dimensional (2D) gingerbread man mental rotation, a 2D alphanumeric mental rotation, of three\u2010dimensional (3D) basketball player mental rotation, and lexical decision making. Additionally, participants completed a paper\u2010 and pencil water level task and an oral verbal fluency task. On the 2D alphanumeric and 3D basketball player mental rotation tasks, men performed better than boys, but the performance of women and girls did not differ. On the water level task, men performed better than women whereas there was no difference between boys and girls. No sex differences were found on the 2D gingerbread man mental rotation, lexical decision\u2010making, and verbal fluency tasks. EEG analyses indicated that men exhibited left posterior temporal activation during the 2D alphanumeric task and that men and boys both exhibited greater left parietal activation than women and girls during the 2D gingerbread man task. On the 3D basketball player mental rotation task, all participants exhibited greater activation of the right parietal area than the left parietal area. These data give insight into the brain activity and cognitive development changes that occur between childhood and adulthood. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 40: 391\u2013407, 2002.

VMeasurement of uronic acids without interference from neutral sugars __ Replacement of carbazole with meta-hydroxydiphenyl greatly improves the determination of uronic acids in the presence of neutral sugars by preventing substantially, but not completely, the browning that occurs during the heating of sugars in concentrated sulfuric acid and avoiding the formation of additional interference by the carbazole reagent (Blumenkrantz, N., and Asboe-Hansen, G. (1973) Anal. Biochem. 54, 484\u2013489). However, interference is still substantial when uronic acids are determined in the presence of excess neutral sugar, particularly because of the browning that occurs during the first heating before addition of the diphenyl reagent. The browning can be essentially eliminated by addition of sulfamate to the reaction mixture (Galambos, J. T. (1967) Anal. Biochem. 19, 119\u2013132). Although others have reported that sulfamate and the diphenyl reagent were incompatible, we find that a small amount of sulfamate suppresses color production by a 20-fold excess of some neutral sugars without substantial sacrifice of the sensitive detection of uronic acids by the diphenyl reagent. Sodium tetraborate is required for the detection of d-mannuronic acid and enhances color production by d-glucuronic acid. We propose this modified sulfamate/m-hydroxydiphenyl assay as a rapid and reliable means for the assay of uronic acids, particularly when present in much smaller amounts than neutral sugars.

VAn Mll\u2013AF9 Fusion Gene Made by Homologous Recombination Causes Acute Leukemia in Chimeric Mice: A Method to Create Fusion Oncogenes __ Homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells has been used to produce a fusion oncogene, thereby mimicking chromosomal translocations that frequently result in formation of tumor-specific fusion oncogenes in human malignancies. AF9 sequences were fused into the mouse Mll gene so that expression of the Mll\u2013AF9 fusion gene occurred from endogenous Mll transcription control elements, as in t(9;11) found in human leukemias. Chimeric mice carrying the fusion gene developed tumors, which were restricted to acute myeloid leukemias despite the widespread activity of the Mll promoter. Onset of perceptible disease was preceded by expansion of ES cell derivatives in peripheral blood. This novel use of homologous recombination formally proves that chromosomal translocations contribute to malignancy and provides a general strategy to create fusion oncogenes for studying their role in tumorigenesis. *Present address: Centro de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, Ronda de Garay, 30003 Murcia, Spain. \u2020 Present address: Wellcome Trust Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge School of Medicine, Cambridge CB2 2SP, United Kingdom.

VVisuospatial abilities in cerebellar disorders __ Background: Cerebellar involvement in spatial data management has been suggested on experimental and clinical grounds. Objective: To attempt a specific analysis of visuospatial abilities in a group of subjects with focal or atrophic cerebellar damage. Methods: Visuospatial performance was tested using the spatial subtests of the WAIS, the Benton line orientation test, and two tests of mental rotation of objects\u2014the Minnesota paper form board test (MIN) and the differential aptitude test (DAT). Results: In the Benton line orientation test, a test of sensory analysis and elementary perception, no deficits were present in subjects with cerebellar damage. In MIN, which analyses the capacity to process bidimensional complex figures mentally, and in the DAT, which is based on mental folding and manipulation of tridimensional stimuli, subjects with cerebellar damage were impaired. Conclusions: The results indicate that lesions of the cerebellar circuits affect visuospatial ability. The ability to rotate objects mentally is a possible functional substrate of the observed deficits. A comparison between visuospatial performance of subjects with focal right and left cerebellar lesions shows side differences in the characteristics of the visuospatial syndrome. Thus cerebellar influences on spatial cognition appear to act on multiple cognitive modules.

VHemispheric Cooperation in Visuospatial Rotations: Evidence for a Manipulation Role for the Left Hemisphere and a Reference Role for the Right Hemisphere __ A survey of mental rotation strategies in 210 normal subjects showed a strong tendency for right-handers to prefer rotating an object on the right and vice versa for left-handers. The differential functioning of the cerebral hemispheres during mental rotation was then assessed in 42 subjects by means of tachistoscopic presentation of two geometrical figures separately to the left and right visual fields-one of which was gravitationally stable and the other unstable. Performance was better when the unstable object was presented to the right visual field and the stable object to the left. This finding is interpreted as indicating more efficient hemispheric cooperation when the active manipulation of a mental image is performed by the left hemisphere, while the reference role is carried out by the right hemisphere.

VSexually acquired infections: do lay experiences of partner notification challenge practice? __ Tile. Sexually acquired infections: do lay experiences of partner notification challenge practice? Aim.\u2002 This paper is a report of a study to explore experiences of partner notification for syphilis from the perspectives of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Background.\u2002 Partner notification is the \u2018cornerstone\u2019 of the prevention and control of sexually acquired infections. As a health strategy, it has been in use for over six decades and is employed across all continents. Its success relies almost entirely on the voluntary response of index patients in disclosing details of their sexual partners and sexual practices and the voluntary response of sexual partners who have been traced. However, internationally, few studies have explicitly explored lay experiences of partner notification. Method.\u2002 A purposive sample of 40 gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men was recruited from two genitourinary clinics in the Greater Dublin area of Ireland and a variety of gay social venues. Semi\u2010structured interviews were carried out between December 2002 and February 2004. Findings.\u2002 Men's perspectives on partner notification featured three interweaving stages: on tracing sexual partners, on informing partners and on attending clinics. Participants were in favour of partner notification, but did not find it easy to comply with the demands it made on their relationships. Compliance was difficult not only because of the problem of physically tracing casual and anonymous partners, but also because of the challenge of actually notifying partners. The main incentive for contacts to attend clinics was concern for their own health and that of others. Barriers to attending were fear of being exposed to the stigma of being gay and/or having a sexually acquired infection. Conclusion.\u2002 There is a need to develop evidence\u2010based methods, which are grounded in the lay experience, to support index patients in \u2018breaking bad news\u2019 and for continued efforts to de\u2010stigmatize sexually acquired infections and homosexuality in the view of the general public.

VIntegrating information from two pictorial animations: Complexity and cognitive prerequisites influence performance __ Dividing visual attention between spatially distinct sources of information could either be beneficial (if there is too much information for a single visualization) or detrimental (if interrelated information has to be mentally re\u2010integrated) for learning. We present a new display technology allowing for the presentation of two distinct animations by avoiding split foci of visual attention: learners are able to switch between animations by moving their head. We examined how 84 naïve learners integrated information in three presentation modes: the \u2018vexing\u2010image\u2019 mode displaying two animations, participants being able to switch between them without shifting the visual focus, a classical \u2018split\u2010screen\u2019 and an \u2018overlaid\u2019 condition. Results showed that reduced complexity led to higher performance. Further, we showed that participants with high mental rotation abilities were best in the \u2018split\u2010screen\u2019 mode, whereas participants with low mental rotation abilities benefited most from the \u2018vexing\u2010image\u2019. Theoretical and instructional consequences of these findings are discussed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VDealuminated zeolite-based composite catalysts for reforming of an industrial naphthene-rich feedstock __ Dealuminated ZSM-12, zeolite \u03b2 and their composites with \u03b3-Al2O3 as a matrix were evaluated for the reforming of an industrial naphtha (rich in naphthenes). The reactions were carried out at temperatures in the 270\u2013470°C range. It was found that dealuminated ZSM-12 demonstrates unique time-on-stream stability for the reactions investigated. This behavior is a combined result of: (a) its pore structure which does not favor coke formation, and (b) the balance of its acidity. Zeolites with channel intersections, which are slightly larger than the zeolite aperture do not favor coke formation. Our results demonstrated that the composite catalysts produce more gasoline-range hydrocarbons and show much better time-on-stream behavior than conventional \u03b3-Al2O3 catalysts. Fresh and deactivated catalysts were characterized by XRD, NH3-stepwise TPD, TGA, and FTIR. Soluble carbonaceous deposits analyzed by high-resolution GC/MS are mostly paraffinic in nature. The paraffin deposits present over the Pt/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst were of higher molecular weight than those over the zeolite catalysts. We propose that, at relatively lower reaction temperatures, the catalyst deactivates via a successive alkylation type of mechanism in which carbonaceous coking precursors propagate through the continuous addition of olefinic intermediates to carbenium/carbonium ions.

VSurface structure of \u03b2-FeSi2(101) epitaxially grown on Si(111) __ Abstract: The surface morphology and structure of \u03b2-FeSi2(101) films epitaxially grown on Si(111) has been studied by means of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). The films are formed by large crystallites which are single domain. Each crystallite has only one of the three possible azimuthal orientations with respect to the substrate. A large density of planar defects, however, is detected on top of each crystallite. They are assigned to intrinsic stacking faults and their existence seems hard to avoid. This high density of intrinsic defects casts serious doubts on the use of \u03b2-FeSi2 as an optoelectronic material.

VIntroduction: Some insights from Western social theory __ This introductory paper surveys a variety of Western analyses of the emergence of a liberal social order, ranging from the Scottish enlightenment, through responses to the French Revolution, and discussions of American exceptionalism, to various Central European reactions to the traumas of the interwar period, to \u201cdependency\u201d theory and Christian Democracy. It identifies a number of central issues that are reappearing, in somewhat modified form, in the analysis of contemporary economic liberalization and political democratization issues in the South and East. Contrary to some recent triumphalism, most Western social theory has been deeply preoccupied with the fragility and reversibility of economic cum political liberalization processes.

VStatistics and archaeology in Israel __ While the field of statistics is fairly young, the field of archaeology is quite old. Modern archaeology prides itself on its ability to glean maximum information about the past from minimal information collected in the present. This paper attempts to show how the application of statistical thinking and techniques can aid the archaeologist in retrieving as much information as possible from artifacts; thus allowing the archaeologists to leave the majority of a site for future generations. In the past few years, archaeologists working in Israel have joined forces with statisticians in an attempt to generate more accurate recordings of archaeological information than is currently the standard in the Middle East. Careful application of statistical methods has reduced collection time and improved the display of archaeological information. An understanding of statistical concepts such as variability and density estimation has already been shown to be of use to archaeologists. Conversely, the use of examples from the field have proven to be of use in motivating humanities students to learn about statistical thinking. Archaeology has also provided a field in which students of statistics may apply their new found knowledge. The combination of statistics and archaeology is clearly of benefit to both disciplines.

VHigh-Resolution Crystals of Methionine Aminopeptidase from Pyrococcus furiosus Obtained by Water-Mediated Transformation __ The monoclinic crystal form of methionine aminopeptidase fromPyrococcus furiosus(MAP-Pfu) has been crystallized from four different conditions. Native crystals belong to space group P21with typical unit-cell dimensionsa= 53.4,b= 85.1,c= 72.7 Å, \u03b2 = 107.7° and diffract to 2.9\u20134.5 Å resolution. However, there is a problem of nonisomorphism among the crystals. Water-mediated transformation to low-humidity form occurs by reduction of the relative humidity of crystal environment to 79%. The unit-cell dimensions of transformed crystals area= 51.9,b= 83.3,c= 70.3 Å, \u03b2 = 105.9°, and the calculated solvent content is 3.9% less than in original crystals. Transformation to low-humidity form is accompanied by 1.7 times reduction of overall temperature factors, extension of diffraction resolution up to 1.75 Å, without change or reduction of crystal mosaicity, and improvement in stability to X-ray radiation. The water-mediated transformation also appears to relieve the problem of nonisomorphism among the original MAP-Pfu crystals.

VA long-term follow-up study of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in delirium __ Abstract: Cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (CSF 5-HIAA) was determined for elderly delirious patients during the acute stage and after a 1-year follow-up period, and the 5-HIAA levels were compared with age-equivalent controls. As compared with the controls, the 5-HIAA levels were significantly higher at the beginning of the index admission in patients with multi-infarct dementia and patients with no apparent CNS disease. The 5-HIAA levels were also higher in the latter subgroup in the 1-year sampling, but no other differences between delirious patients and controls were observed. The one-way procedure showed no differences between the subgroup means of delirious patients when divided according to the severity of cognitive decline or type of delirium in any of the samples. The 5-HIAA levels measured during the index admission correlated with the length of life after delirium suggesting that serotonergic dysfunction may have prognostic significance in delirious patients.

VDNA damage induces Cdt1 proteolysis in fission yeast through a pathway dependent on Cdt2 and Ddb1 __ Cdt1 is an essential protein required for licensing of replication origins. Here, we show that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cdt1 is proteolysed in M and G1 phases in response to DNA damage and that this mechanism seems to be conserved from yeast to Metazoa. This degradation does not require Rad3 and Cds1, indicating that it is independent of classic DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathways. Damage\u2010induced degradation of Cdt1 is dependent on Cdt2 and Ddb1, which are components of a Cul4 ubiquitin ligase. We also show that Cdt2 and Ddb1 are needed for cell\u2010cycle changes in Cdt1 levels in the absence of DNA damage. Cdt2 and Ddb1 have been shown to be involved in the degradation of the Spd1 inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase after DNA damage, and we speculate that Cdt1 downregulation might contribute to genome stability by reducing demand on dNTP pools during DNA repair.

VVolitional control of attention and brain activation in dual task performance __ This study used functional MRI (fMRI) to examine the neural effects of willfully allocating one's attention to one of two ongoing tasks. In a dual task paradigm, participants were instructed to focus either on auditory sentence comprehension, mental rotation, or both. One of the major findings is that the distribution of brain activation was amenable to strategic control, such that the amount of activation per task was systematically related to the attention\u2010dividing instructions. The activation in language processing regions was lower when attending to mental rotation than when attending to the sentences, and the activation in visuospatial processing regions was lower when attending to sentences than when attending to mental rotations. Additionally, the activation was found to be underadditive, with the dual\u2010task condition eliciting less activation than the sum of the attend sentence and attend rotation conditions. We also observed a laterality shift across conditions within language\u2010processing regions, with the attend sentence condition showing bilateral activation, while the dual task condition showed a left hemispheric dominance. This shift suggests multiple language\u2010processing modes and may explain the underadditivity in activation observed in the current and previous studies. Hum.

VTask-specific effects of orientation information: neuropsychological evidence __ The deficits underlying orientation agnosia in a patient (MB) with a right fronto-temporo-parietal lesion were examined. Like similar patients in the literature, MB was impaired at discriminating whether objects were upright or not and, in copying, she tended to re-represent stimuli as upright. In addition, MB failed to show the normal effects of rotation on object identification; her naming of objects rotated 45° from upright was no slower than her naming of upright items. Effects of the degree of rotation did emerge, however, when she had to perform a matching task that required mental rotation. The evidence suggests that orientation may be coded in several ways (e.g. separately between objects and relative to the viewer), and that brain-damage can selectively affect the use of some but not all types of orientation information.

VMonolithic Disk\u2010Supported Metathesis Catalysts for Use in Combinatorial Chemistry __ Two metathesis catalysts, RuCl2(PCy3)(NHC)(CHPh) (1) [NHC=1\u2010(2,4,5\u2010trimethylphenyl)\u20103\u2010(6\u2010hydroxyhexyl)\u2010imidazol\u20102\u2010ylidene] and Mo(N\u20102,6\u2010i\u2010Pr2\u2010C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)(BIPHEN) (2) [BIPHEN=(R)\u20103,3\u2032\u2010di\u2010t\u2010butyl\u20105,5\u2032,6,6\u2032\u2010tetramethyl\u20102,2\u2032\u2010biphenolate) have been immobilized on polymeric, monolithic discs using a \u201cgrafting from\u201d protocol. Monolithic discs were prepared via ring\u2010opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) from norborn\u20102\u2010ene (NBE), tris(norborn\u20105\u2010ene\u20102\u2010ylmethyleneoxy)methylsilane [(NBE\u2010CH2O)3\u2010SiCH3], 2\u2010propanol, toluene and RuCl2(PCy3)2(CHPh). Catalyst loadings of 0.55 and 0.7 wt\u2005%, respectively, were obtained. Monolithic disc\u2010immobilized 1 was used in various metathesis\u2010based reactions including ring\u2010closing metathesis (RCM), ring\u2010opening cross metathesis and enyne metathesis. Using 0.23\u20130.59\u2005mol\u2005% of supported 1, turnover numbers (TONs) up to 330 were achieved. Monolithic disc\u2010immobilized 2 was used in various enantioselective RCM and desymmetrization reactions. Using 9\u201313\u2005mol\u2005% of supported catalyst, excellent yields up to 100% and high enantiomeric excess (ee\u226488%) were observed. In both cases, metal leaching was low (\u22643 and \u22642%, respectively). In addition, 1 catalyzed the cyclopolymerization of diethyl dipropargylmalonate (DEDPM) to yield poly(ene)s consisting of 5\u2010membered rings, i.e., cyclopent\u20101\u2010ene\u20101\u2010vinylene units. The polymerization proceeded via non\u2010stoichiometric initiation yielding polymers with unimodal molecular weight distribution. Using a catalyst to monomer ratio of 1\u2009:\u2009170, molecular weights of Mw=16,400 and Mn=11,700\u2005g/mol, PDI=1.40 were obtained.

VMicroplasmas: Sources, Particle Kinetics, and Biomedical Applications __ Thanks to their portability and the non\u2010equilibrium character of the discharges, microplasmas are finding application in many scientific disciplines. Although microplasma research has traditionally been application driven, microplasmas represent a new realm in plasma physics that still is not fully understood. This paper reviews existing microplasma sources and discusses charged particle kinetics in various microdischarges. The non\u2010equilibrium character highlighted in this manuscript raises concerns about the accuracy of fluid models and should trigger further kinetic studies of high\u2010pressure microdischarges. Finally, an outlook is presented on the biomedical application of microplasmas.

VThe possible role of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 in inducing tumor-associated metabolic alterations __ Abstract: This study was conducted to investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in inducing cancer cachexia, and the results were compared with those obtained from our previous study on Fisher 344 rats with methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma. Three groups of male Fisher 344 rats received one of the following regimens: 4×104 IU of human recombinant TNF-\u03b1 per rat per day subcutaneously (sc) for 5 consecutive days (n=5), 3.5×105 U human recombinant IL-2 per rat per day sc for 14 consecutive days (n=5), or normal saline (n=5). The activities of both phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and malic enzyme (ME) were increased slightly in the IL-2 group. Furthermore, LPL activity was significantly increased in the adipose tissue of the TNF group and in the cardiac muscle of the IL-2 group, but not in that of the TNF group. These results show that there is a significant difference between the metabolic alterations seen in the tumor-bearing state and those induced by either TNF-\u03b1 or IL-2 alone. Thus, it is unlikely that IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1 is the sole mediator of cancer cachexia in this tumor and rat model.

VEvolutionary Algorithms for Real-World Instances of the Automatic Frequency Planning Problem in GSM Networks __ Abstract : Frequency assignment is a well-known problem in Operations Research for which different mathematical models exist depending on the application specific conditions. However, most of these models are far from considering actual technologies currently deployed in GSM networks (e.g. frequency hopping). These technologies allow the network capacity to be actually increased to some extent by avoiding the interferences provoked by channel reuse due to the limited available radio spectrum, thus improving the Quality of Service (QoS) for subscribers and an income for the operators as well. Therefore, the automatic generation of frequency plans in real GSM networks is of great importance for present GSM operators. This is known as the Automatic Frequency Planning (AFP) problem. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem for a realistic-sized, real-world GSM network by using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). To be precise, we have developed a (1,\u03bb) EA for which very specialized operators have been proposed and analyzed. Results show that this algorithmic approach is able to compute accurate frequency plans for real-world instances.

VSelection and Use of Postharvest Technologies as a Component of the Food Chain __ ABSTRACT: Postharvest technologies refer to the stabilization and storage of unprocessed or minimally processed foods from the time of harvest until final preparation for human consumption. There is a special emphasis on seasonal crops, and simple, labor\u2010intensive, capital\u2010sparing technologies suitable for developing countries where food spoilage rates are high and malnutrition is prevalent. The first step is to determine the major spoilage vectors for each type of food and then identify a technology that will control that vector. For cereal grains the major spoilage vectors are mold, insects, rodents, and other vertebrate pests. Mold is controlled by prompt and adequate drying to a water activity below 0.7. Insects are controlled by good housekeeping, and use of insecticides and fumigants. Rodents are controlled by baits, traps, fumigants, and rodent\u2010proof storage structures. For fruits, vegetables, roots, and tubers the main spoilage vectors are bruising, rotting, senescence, and wilting. Bruising is avoided by careful handling and use of shock\u2010resistant packaging. Rotting is controlled by good housekeeping, gentle handling to avoid breaking the skin, cool storage, and use of preservatives. Senescence is retarded by cold storage or controlled\u2010atmosphere storage. Wilting is controlled by high humidity and cold storage. Growth of microbes is the major spoilage of fish and other foods of animal origin. This is controlled by refrigerated or frozen storage, drying, freezing, or canning. Most spoilage vectors accelerate as the temperature and humidity increase; this makes it more difficult to control spoilage in tropical than in temperate regions.

VSelective Transport of Animal Parts by Ancient Hunters: A New Statistical Method and an Application to the Emeryville Shellmound Fauna __ When deciding which parts of a prey animal to transport home, hunters may be more or less selective. In our vocabulary, unselective hunters are those who usually bring home most of the carcass; selective hunters are those who usually abandon all but the choicest (and/or lightest) parts. This paper uses the abcml statistical method to develop a means of estimating transport selectivity from the frequencies of skeletal parts in a faunal assemblage. It then applies the method to artiodactyl data from the Emeryville Shellmound in order to test the local depression and distant patch use hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that selectivity should decline during the early part of the Emeryville sequence and rise during the later part. The initial analysis did reveal such a pattern, but this pattern disappeared when samples were pooled in order to produce acceptably narrow confidence intervals. Although this result weakens the hypothesis, it does not firmly refute it, because the model fits the data imperfectly in the critical middle portion of the sequence. Abcml also provides estimates of the intensity of attrition, which indicate that attrition was most severe in early strata and least severe in later ones. Substantial attrition (50% of bones surviving) is indicated even from samples that show no indication of attrition using conventional methods. These conclusions are based on assumptions about the processes of transport and attrition that are more reliable in qualitative outline than in quantitative detail. Consequently, the paper's qualitative conclusions are more trustworthy than its quantitative estimates.

VEvolution of sex differences in spatial cognition __ Psychological research has now clearly demonstrated that there is a significant difference between men and women in their performance on certain spatial tasks. Evidence further suggests that this difference has a neurological basis. This hypothesis is well enough established to have inspired several additional hypotheses concerning the evolutionary origin of the difference, including hypotheses emphasizing male hunting, female foraging, and male reproductive strategy. In this article we examine these hypotheses by placing them against the evidence for the neurological basis for the sex difference and the archaeological evidence for the evolution of spatial thinking in general. Given the probable source of the neurological difference in the timing of fetal testosterone, hypotheses that emphasize selection for female cognitive abilities are handicapped from the start. The hypotheses favoring male hunting and male reproductive strategy stumble when evaluated in light of the timing of the evolution of spatial cognition; archaeological evidence for the proposed selective behaviors and for the spatial abilities in question (e.g., mental rotation) do not correspond in a way that would permit a link between them. We conclude that none of the proposed adaptationist hypotheses fit the evidence as it currently exists, and that the modern sex difference in spatial cognition is almost certainly an evolutionary by\u2010product of selection for optimal rates of fetal development. © 1996 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VCharacterization of pseudorabies virus neutralization antigen glycoprotein gIII produced in insect cells by a baculovirus expression vector __ The gene encoding the complete glycoprotein of pseudorabies virus (PRV, Yamagata-S81 strain glycoprotein gIII) has been inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcYM1S derived from the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Autographa califomica (AcNPV). A Spodoptera frugiperda cell line, SF21AE, was efficiently co-transfected with the transfer vector containing the gIII gene and AcNPV DNA by cationic liposomes (Lipofectin). The gene was placed under the control of the AcNPV polyhedrin promoter and expressed to high levels by the derived recombinant virus using SF21AE. Three polypeptides of different molecular weight were expressed. The principal products were glycosylated and transported to the cell surface. The smallest product was not glycosylated. Despite their lower molecular weight, it has been established that the antigenic properties of the peptides were conserved by comparison with those of the authentic glycoprotein gIII of PRV. Immunogenicity of the expressed products was also demonstrated. Intraperitoneal injection of expressed gIII induced neutralizing antibodies in mice. The results have raised the possibility that the protein expressed by baculovirus recombinant may be used to analyze biologically functional sites, develop a subunit vaccine and diagnostic antigens.

VClosing the Technology Gap? __ This paper focuses on the dimensions shaping the dynamics of technology. We present a model where the knowledge stock of a country grows over time as a function of three main factors: innovation intensity, technological infrastructures, and human capital. The latter two variables determine the absorptive capacity of a country as well as its innovative ability. We then carry out an empirical analysis that investigates the dynamics of technology in a large sample of economies in the last two\u2010decade period, and studies its relationships with income per capita growth. The results indicate that the cross\u2010country distributions of technological infrastructures and human capital have experienced a process of convergence, whereas the innovative intensity is characterized by increasing polarization between rich and poor economies. Thus, while the conditions for catching up have generally improved, the increasing innovation gap represents a major factor behind the observed differences in income per capita.

VExpression of c- yes oncogene product in various animal tissues and spontaneous canine tumours __ An immunohistochemical study of various visceral organs of normal adult dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cows, and chickens (five of each species) and of 185 spontaneous canine tumours was carried out using paraffin wax sections and a commercially available antibody to the human c- yes oncogene product. Among the adult normal tissues of six animal species, epithelial cells of the proximal and distal renal tubules, the myocardium, hepatocytes, cerebellar Purkinje cells and adrenal cortical cells were positive for c- yes product. Among the foetal tissues of dogs and chickens, a positive reaction was observed on canine chorionic villi cells and chick yolk sac surface epithelium, and on epithelial cells of the renal tubules, hepatocytes and the myocardium. These findings suggest that the c- yes proto-oncogene may play a physiological role in the cell growth and metabolism of these adult and foetal tissues. Of the 185 tumours tested, 59 (31·9 per cent) expressed the c- yes oncogene product. The c- yes -positive tumours accounted for 44·4 per cent (12/27) of the skin tumours, 5·5 per cent (1/18) of the round cell tumours, 35·7 per cent (10/28) of the soft tissue tumours, 21·4 per cent (3/14) of the testicular tumours, 29·1 per cent (23/79) of the mammary tumours, and 52·6 per cent (10/19) of the other tumours types. Expression of the c- yes oncogene appeared to be common in spontaneously arising canine tumours, and the degree of expression varied considerably by tumour type.

VOxygen Content, Crystal Structure, and Superconductivity in YSr2Cu2.75Mo0.25O7+\u03b4 __ Polycrystalline samples of YSr2Cu2.75Mo0.25O7+\u03b4 with different oxygen contents are investigated by powder X\u2010ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction. The temperature dependence of resistivity and the oxygen content are determined. The air\u2010sintered sample is tetragonal and semiconductive, while the O2\u2010sintered sample is orthorhombic and superconducting at 26 K. It is suggested that the structural variation originates from the (Cu(1), Mo)O1+\u03b4 layers and the superconductivity is induced by the excess oxygen rather than charge redistribution between Cu(1) and Cu(2).

VPti1p and Ref2p found in association with the mRNA 3\u2032 end formation complex direct snoRNA maturation __ Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcribes precursors of mRNAs and of non\u2010protein\u2010coding RNAs such as snRNAs and snoRNAs. These RNAs have to be processed at their 3\u2032 ends to be functional. mRNAs are matured by cleavage and polyadenylation that require a well\u2010characterized protein complex. Small RNAs are also subject to 3\u2032 end cleavage but are not polyadenylated. Here we show that two newly identified proteins, Pti1p and Ref2p, although they were found associated with the pre\u2010mRNA 3\u2032 end processing complex, are essential for yeast snoRNA 3\u2032 end maturation. We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the Nrd1p\u2010dependent pathway for 3\u2032 end formation of non\u2010polyadenylated transcripts.

VBlock Design Performance in the Williams Syndrome Phenotype: A Problem with Mental Imagery? __ Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare genetic disorder which, among other characteristics, has a distinctive cognitive profile. Nonverbal abilities are generally poor in relation to verbal abilities, but also show varying levels of ability in relation to each other. Performance on block construction tasks represents arguably the weakest nonverbal ability in WS. In this study we examined two requirements of block construction tasks in 21 individuals with WS and 21 typically developing (TD) control individuals. The Squares tasks, a novel twodimensional block construction task, manipulated patterns by segmentation and perceptual cohesiveness to investigate the first factor, processing preference (local or global), and by obliqueness to examine the second factor, the ability to use mental imagery. These two factors were investigated directly by the Children's Embeded Figures Test (CEFT; Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, & Karp, 1971) and a mental rotation task respectively. Results showed that individuals with WS did not differ from the TD group in their processing style. However, the ability to use mental imagery was significantly poorer in the WS group than the TD group. This suggests that weak performance on the block construction tasks in WS may relate to an inability to use mental imagery.

VCognitive load and mental rotation: structuring orthographic projection for learning and problem solving __ Abstract: Cognitive load theory was used to generate a series of three experiments to investigate the effects of various worked example formats on learning orthographic projection. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the benefits of presenting problems, conventional worked examples incorporating the final 2-D and 3-D representations only, and modified worked examples with several intermediate stages of rotation between the 2-D and 3-D representations. Modified worked examples proved superior to conventional worked examples without intermediate stages while conventional worked examples were, in turn, superior to problems. Experiment 3 investigated the consequences of varying the number and location of intermediate stages in the rotation trajectory and found three stages to be superior to one. A single intermediate stage was superior when nearer the 2-D than the 3-D end of the trajectory. It was concluded that (a) orthographic projection is learned best using worked examples with several intermediate stages and that (b) a linear relation between angle of rotation and problem difficulty did not hold for orthographic projection material. Cognitive load theory could be used to suggest the ideal location of the intermediate stages.

VAnnealing of AsGa-related defects in LT-GaAs: The role of gallium vacancies __ Abstract: We have studied the annealing properties of AsGa-related defects in layers of GaAs grown at low substrate temperatures (300°C) by molecular beam epitaxy (low temperature[LTx]-GaAs). The concentration of neutral AsGa-related native defects, estimated by infrared absorption measurements, ranges from 2×1019 to 1×1020 cm\u22123. Slow positron annihilation results indicate an excess concentration of Ga vacancies in LT layers over bulk grown crystals. A sharp annealing stage at 450°C marks a rapid decrease in the AsGa defect concentration. We propose that the defect removal mechanism is the diffusion of AsGa to arsenic precipitates, which is enhanced by the presence of excess VGa. The supersaturated concentration of VGa must also decrease. Hence, the diffusivity of the AsGa defects is time dependent. Analysis of isothermal annealing kinetics gives an enthalpy of migration of 2.0±0.3 eV for the photoquenchable AsGa defects, 1.5±0.3 eV for the VGa, and 1.1±0.3 eV for the nonphotoquenchable defects. The difference in activation enthalpy represents difference energy between an As atom and Ga atom swapping sites with a VGa.

VThe Representation of Location in Visual Images __ By definition, visual image representations are organized around spatial properties. However, we know very little about how these representations use information about location, one of the most important spatial properties. Three experiments explored how location information is incorporated into image representations. All of these experiments used a mental rotation task in which the location of the stimulus varied from trial to trial. If images are location specific, these changes should affect the way images are used. The effects from image representations were separated from those of general spatial attention mechanisms by shape. With shape information, subjects could use an image as a template, and they recognized the stimulus more quickly when it was at the same location as the image. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects were able to use visual image representations effectively without knowing where the stimulus would appear, but left open the possibility that image location must be adjusted before use. In Experiment 2, distance between the stimulus location and the image location was varied systematically, and response time increased with distance. Therefore image representations appear to be location-specific, though the represented location can be adjusted easily. In Experiment 3, a saccade was introduced between the image cue and the test stimulus, in order to test wether subjects responded more quickly when the test stimulus appeared at the same retinotopic location or same spatiotopic location as the cue. The results suggest that the location is coded retinotopically in image representations. This finding has implications not only for visual imagery but also for visual processing in general, because it suggests that there is no spatiotopic transform in the early stages of visual processing.

VStrategic effects on object-based attentional selection __ The same-object benefit, that is faster and/or more accurate performance when two target properties to be identified appear on one object than when each of the properties appear on different objects, has been a robust and theoretically important finding in the study of attentional selection. Indeed, the same-object benefit has been interpreted to suggest that attention can be used to select objects and perceptual groups rather than unparsed regions of visual space. In the present studies we report and explore a different-object benefit, that is faster identification performance when two target properties appear on different objects than when they appear on a single object. The results from the three experiments suggest that the different-object benefit was the result of mental rotation and translation strategies that subjects performed on objects in an effort to determine whether two target properties matched or mismatched. These image manipulation strategies appear to be performed with similar but not with dissimilar target properties. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the study of object-based attentional selection.

VHow Applicants Want and Expect to Be Treated: Applicants' Selection Treatment Beliefs and the Development of the Social Process Questionnaire on Selection __ In psychology, general beliefs are considered to be the stepping\u2010stones of future behavior and attitudes (Rokeach, 1973; Olson, Roese, & Zanna, 1996). The goal of this paper is to explore applicants' general beliefs about the selection treatment, namely the way they want and expect to be treated during selection. After the concept of selection treatment beliefs is introduced and both its theoretical and practical relevance is highlighted, the development of the Social Process Questionnaire on Selection (SPQS) is reported, which measures selection treatment beliefs. Factor analyses (660 students and 643 applicants) revealed six treatment factors. Applicants valued and expected transparency, objectivity, feedback, job information, participation, and a humane treatment. Apparently, applicants valued the six factors more than they expected them to be realized. The scientific and practical relevance of the findings are discussed.

VA curvilinear relationship between hair loss and mental rotation and neuroticism: a possible influence of sustained dihydrotestosterone production __ Hairline measurements and ratings of father's hair loss were used in a multiple regression to predict hair loss in 181 males. This was hypothesised to measure the effects of cumulative dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on hairline. Participants were also given a test of mental rotation, and rated their own anger and neuroticism. They were then divided into five groups according to level of hair loss. Significant effects were found for mental rotation and neuroticism. Mental rotation was an inverted-U function of the extent of hair loss, indicating a curvilinear relationship between DHT and spatial cognition. Neuroticism also demonstrated an inverted U relationship, but this function was less clear visually and statistically. The self-rated measures of anger were not affected by DHT. One implication of the effect of mental rotation as a function of hair loss is that long-term high or low levels of DHT could impair spatial cognition in men.

VAbsence of Hemispheric Dominance for Mental Rotation Ability: A Transcranial Doppler Study __ Mean blood flow velocity (MFV) of the middle cerebral arteries was monitored in 19 healthy, adult, right-handed subjects during the resting phase and the execution of a series of neuropsychological tests: two right/left discrimination tasks, two mental rotation paradigms (the Ratcliff's test and a cube comparison test) and a phonemic fluency task, which was utilised as an internal control. In the group as a whole, the Ratcliff's test was associated with a significant bilateral increase in MFV versus both the resting state (right: p < .000001, left: p < .000001) and right/left discrimination tasks (task 1: right: p = .003, left: p = .005; task 2: right: p = .001, left: p = .001). The cube comparison in turn produced a significant increase in MFV versus both the baseline conditions (right: p < .000001, left: p < .000001) and the Ratcliff's test (right: p = .01, left: p = .002). As expected, the fluency task was associated with a significant asymmetric increase in cerebral perfusion (left > right: p = .0001). Increasing task difficulty (right/left discrimination < Ratcliff's test < cube comparison) was paralleled by a roughly proportional rise in MFV values (right: r = .424, p < .01; left: r = .331, p = .01). In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that (1) in addition to the amount of MFV variation due to right/left discrimination (when required), mental rotation per se causes a biemispheric activation irrespective of the experimental paradigm; (2) the MFV variation is proportional to the difficulty of the tasks.

VThe relative effectiveness of computer\u2010based and traditional resources for education in anatomy __ There is increasing use of computer\u2013based resources to teach anatomy, although no study has compared computer\u2010based learning to traditional. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of three formats of anatomy learning: (1) a virtual reality (VR) computer\u2010based module, (2) a static computer\u2010based module providing Key Views (KV), (3) a plastic model. We conducted a controlled trial in which 60 undergraduate students had ten minutes to study the names of 20 different pelvic structures. The outcome measure was a 25 item short answer test consisting of 15 nominal and 10 functional questions, based on a cadaveric pelvis. All subjects also took a brief mental rotations test (MRT) as a measure of spatial ability, used as a covariate in the analysis. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA. The group learning from the model performed significantly better than the other two groups on the nominal questions (Model 67%; KV 40%; VR 41%, Effect size 1.19 and 1.29, respectively). There was no difference between the KV and VR groups. There was no difference between the groups on the functional questions (Model 28%; KV, 23%, VR 25%). Computer\u2010based learning resources appear to have significant disadvantages compared to traditional specimens in learning nominal anatomy. Consistent with previous research, virtual reality shows no advantage over static presentation of key views. Anat Sci Educ 6: 211\u2013215. © 2013 American Association of Anatomists.

VMental Rotation at 7 Years - Relations with Prenatal Testosterone Levels and Spatial Play Experiences __ Biological and social-experiential factors appear to play a role in the male advantage in spatial abilities. In the present study, relations among prenatal testosterone levels, spatial play experiences, and mental rotation task performance were explored in 7-year-old boys and girls. A positive correlation was observed between prenatal testosterone levels and rate of rotation in girls. The findings were less clear for boys, but suggested the opposite pattern of results. Relations between spatial play preferences and mental rotation task performance were not observed in children of either sex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that testosterone acts on the fetal brain to influence the development of spatial ability.

VVisual-Spatial Representation, Mathematical Problem Solving, and Students of Varying Abilities __ The purpose of this study was to investigate students\u2019 use of visual imagery while solving mathematical problems. Students with learning disabilities (LD), average achievers, and gifted students in sixth grade (N = 66) participated in this study. Students were assessed on measures of mathematical problem solving and visual-spatial representation. Visual-spatial representations were coded as either primarily schematic representations that encode the spatial relations described in the problem or primarily pictorial representations that encode persons, places, or things described in the problem. Results indicated that gifted students used significantly more visual-spatial representations than the other two groups. Students with LD used significantly more pictorial representations than their peers. Successful mathematical problem solving was positively correlated with use of schematic representations; conversely, it was negatively correlated with use of pictorial representations.

VA prospective evaluation of prehospital 12-lead ECG application in chest pain patients __ The objective of this study was to prospectively determine the utility, efficiency, and reliability of early prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) application, the improvement in prehospital diagnostic accuracy, and paramedic and base physician opinions regarding early application of prehospital 12-lead ECGs in a broad range of stable chest pain patients. The patient population consisted of cooperative, stable adult prehospital patients with a chief complaint of nontraumatic chest pain of presumed ischemic origin. From July 17, 1989 through January 1, 1990 paramedics acquired prehospital 12-lead ECGs on 680 stable adult chest pain patients. Factors affecting prehospital 12-lead ECG application were evaluated. Paramedic application of prehospital 12-lead ECGs was found to be efficient and reliable, and it can be applied to most cooperative stable adult prehospital chest pain patients. Prehospital 12-lead ECGs significantly improve base physicians' diagnostic accuracy in myocardial infarction, angina, and nonischemic chest pain patients. Paramedic and base physicians' opinions regarding early application of prehospital 12-lead ECGs during patient evaluation were favorable.

VDirect and indirect impacts of Saharan dust acting as cloud condensation nuclei on tropical cyclone eyewall development __ The mechanisms by which Saharan dust acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) impact tropical cyclone (TC) evolution were examined by conducting numerical simulations of a mature TC with CCN added from lateral boundaries. CCN can affect eyewall development directly through release of latent heat when activated and subsequent growth of cloud droplets and indirectly through modulating rainband development. Convection in the rainbands was negatively correlated with that in the eyewall in all simulations. The development of rainbands tended to promote latent heat release away from the eyewall, block the surface inflow and enhance cold pools. The maximum impact of rainbands on the eyewall (or vice versa) occurred with a time lag of 3.5 to 5.5 hr. The convection in the eyewall and rainbands did not show a monotonic relationship to input CCN due to the non\u2010linear feedback of heating from a myriad of microphysical processes on storm dynamics.

VChoosing the preventive workload in general practice: practical application of the Coronary Prevention Group guidelines and Dundee coronary risk-disk. __ OBJECTIVE--To determine the workload implications for general practice of the Coronary Prevention Group and British Heart Foundation action plan for preventing heart disease. DESIGN--Computer simulation of plan, including calculation of Dundee risk scores, with data from OXCHECK trial. SUBJECTS--4759 patients aged 35-64 who had health checks during 1989-91. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Effect of using different risk scores as thresholds on workload and coverage of patients at known risk. Thresholds of 6-20 were used for cholesterol screening (nearset) and 4-16 for special care (preset). RESULTS--On the basis of workload a nearset of 8 and preset of 12 would be reasonable. This implies cholesterol measurement in 1794 (37.7%) patients and special care in 1074 (22.6%). However, many patients with single risk factors were not allocated to special care at these thresholds: 11 (37.9%) patients with cholesterol concentrations > or = 10 mmol/l, 21 (33.9%) with systolic pressure > or = 180 mm Hg, and 213 (40.7%) heavy smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) were missed. The distribution of scores was similar in those at established clinical risk, those with family history of heart disease, and others. CONCLUSION--The guidelines may help to make best use of resources within specific age-sex groups but sound protocols for unifactorial risk assessment and modification remain essential.

VAtherosclerotic plaque rupture: a fatigue process? __ The mechanism of atherosclerotic plaque rupture is not known. Current theories focus on the acute triggers of plaque rupture and myocardial infarction such as increased shear or circumferential stress, rupture of the vasa vasorum and vasospasm. We hypothesize that a critical mechanism causing plaque rupture is fatigue failure, the catastrophic rupture of a material following exposure to high-cycle, low-amplitude repetitive stress. Comparisons between material fatigue and plaque rupture demonstrate that this hypothesis is consistent with known physiologic and epidemiologic data on plaque rupture.

VExcited state calculations of Europium(III) complexes __ A new theoretical methodology developed to guide the design of light-conversion molecular devices is applied to the complex tris(3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylate)(1,10-phenanthroline) of Eu(III), and the results are compared to the experimental data obtained in our laboratory. The calculations have shown that there are two triplet states at 363 and 377 nm localized on the 1,10-phenanthroline, which are quasi-resonant with the 5G6 (374 nm) and 5L6 (395 nm) energy levels of the Eu(III) ion, respectively. The 3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylate anion ligands have a richer quasi-resonant energy level structure, namely, three singlet states (344, 323 and 377 nm) and their corresponding triplet states (498, 509 and 530 nm), which are near-resonant to the 5D4 and 5D0 Eu(III) energy levels, respectively. These ligand and metal ion energy levels were used in the dipole\u2013dipole and dipole-2\u2113-pole models for energy transfer rate calculations. Thus, the high quantum yield observed for this complex (28% in DMSO solution) seems to be due to the calculated high yield energy transfer from these several ligand states to the quasi-resonant Eu(III) energy levels.

VHistone genes are located at the sphere loci of Xenopus lampbrush chromosomes __ Abstract: In the anuran Xenopus, as has been demonstrated previously in several species of urodele Amphibia, histone genes lie at the sphere organizer loci of the lampbrush chromosomes. They were located by in situ hybridization of a 3H-labelled histone H4 anti-sense cRNA probe applied to lampbrush preparations in which transcript RNA had been retained, and likewise to preparations in which transcripts were absent but whose DNA had been denatured prior to hybridization. In Xenopus the histone genes lie in intimate association with the spheres that are attached to the lampbrush chromosomes, but they are absent from spheres that lie free in the germinal vesicle. The Anura separated from the Urodela several hundred million years ago, so the sphere organizer/histone gene association is of great antiquity. This suggests that the association has a functional significance, though it is one that has yet to be discovered.

VAlcohol\u2010dehydrogenase\u2010catalyzed production of chiral hydrophobic alcohols. A new approach leading to a nearly waste\u2010free process __ The enantioselective enzyme\u2010catalyzed reduction of ketones in an enzyme membrane reactor coupled to a membrane\u2010based extractive product separation was developed for the production of chiral hydrophobic alcohols. Enantiomerically pure (S)\u20101\u2010phenylpropan\u20102\u2010ol, (S)\u20104\u2010phenylbutan\u20102\u2010ol and (S)\u20106\u2010methylhept\u20105\u2010en\u20102\u2010ol (sulcatol) were obtained with high purities. In spite of low substrate concentrations (9\u201012 mM) space\u2010time yields higher than 100 g/(l·d) and concentrated product solutions were obtained. Formate\u2010dehydrogenase\u2010catalyzed regeneration of cofactor, together with process\u2010integrated recycling of cofactor, led to total\u2010turnover numbers for NAD+ of up to 1350 molP/molNAD, which means a 25\u2010fold increase in comparison with standard techniques without cofactor retention. Because of the closed\u2010loop design of the reactor the process can be run almost without waste, yielding the pure chiral alcohol and CO2.

VShort-term control of root: shoot partitioning __ We present data showing that the fraction of the available photosynthate partitioned between the root and the shoot of a barley seedling is affected by the supply of photosynthate from the source leaf: an increased fraction of the exported photosynthate goes to the shoot when supply is reduced. Also, if the roots are cooled a short time before reducing the supply of photosynthate, then the effect of a reduced supply upon partitioning is reversed with an increased fraction then going to the root. We conclude that the distribution of available photosynthate between competing sinks is influenced by source supply as well as sink function. The reported source-sink interactions are consistant with the predictions of a recently pro posed model of source-sink interaction (Minchin et al., 1993). The concept of marginal partitioning is introduced to describe the distribution, between all of the sinks, of a small change in photosynthate supply.

VUnraveling the cerebral dynamics of mental imagery __ Evidence from functional brain imaging studies suggests that mental imagery processes, like other higher cognitive functions, simultaneously activate different neuronal networks involving multiple cortical areas. The question of whether these different areas are truly simultaneously active or whether they are temporally distinct and might reflect different steps of information processing cannot be answered by these imaging methods. We applied spatiotemporal analysis techniques to multichannel event\u2010related potential (ERP) recordings in order to elucidate the topography and chronology of brain processes involved in mental rotation. We measured 41\u2010electrode ERPs in 12 healthy subjects who had to evaluate whether rotated letters were in a normal or mirror\u2010reflected position. These figures were presented in the left, right, or central visual fields and were randomly rotated by 0°, 50°, 100°, or 150°. Behaviorally, we replicated the observation that reaction time increases with greater angles of rotation. Electrophysiologically, we identified a set of dominant electric potential distributions, each of them stable for a certain time period. Only one of these time segments (appearing between 400\u2013600 msec) increased significantly in duration with greater angles of rotation mirroring reaction time. We suggest that the rotation of mental images is carried out during this time segment. A general linear inverse solution applied to this segment showed occipito\u2010parietal cerebral activity that was lateralized to the right hemisphere. Hum.

VA structural analysis of visual spatial ability in academically talented students __ The structure of spatial ability in a population of academically talented youth was explored. Methods of Facet Theory and Multidimensional Similarity Structure Analysis (SSA) were used to analyze the correlational structure of performance on 14 types of figural spatial tests in 2 samples of subjects. As in previous research, a cylindrical wedge model was found to describe the underlying structure well. The facet of dimensionality was represented in a polar way with the three-dimensional tasks in the core of a radex-like configuration and the two-dimensional tests in the periphery. The facet of mental rotation was identified to play a modular role as two different subregions in the SSA solutions, one representing two-dimensional rotation and one representing three-dimensional rotation. Memory load was represented in a similar fashion in one of the projections. Speededness emerged as a separate dimension in one of the plots. Indications for the existence of one more facet were found. The results agreed quite well with findings of previous research in this area.

VA study of the effects of tunneling currents and reliability of sub-2 nm gate oxides on scaled n-MOSFETs __ This work examined various components of direct gate tunneling currents and analyzed reliability of ultrathin gate oxides (1.4\u20132 nm) in scaled n-metal-oxide-semiconductor field effective transistor (MOSFETs). Direct gate tunneling current components were studied both experimentally and theoretically. In addition to gate tunneling currents, oxide reliability was investigated as well. Constant voltage stressing was applied to the gate oxides. The oxide breakdown behaviors were observed and their effects on device performance were studied. The ultrathin oxides in scaled n-MOSFETs used in this study showed distinct breakdown behavior and strong location dependence. No \u201csoft\u201d breakdown was seen for 1.5 nm oxide with small area, implying the importance of using small and more realistic MOS devices for ultrathin oxide reliability study instead of using large area devices. Higher frequency of oxide breakdowns in the source/drain extension to the gate overlap region was then observed in the channel region. Possible explanations to the observed breakdown behaviors were proposed based on the quantum mechanical effects and point-contact model for electron conduction in the oxide during the breakdown. It was concluded that the source/drain extension to the gate overlap regions have strong effects on the device performance in terms of both gate tunneling currents and oxide reliability.

VBubble Sizes in Electrolyte and Alcohol Solutions in a Turbulent Stirred Vessel __ Bubble size distributions have been measured by a new video technique at 3 points near the wall in a vessel of 150 mm diameter air-sparged at 1 vvm agitated by a Rushton turbine at an energy dissipation rate of 1Wkg-1. Water and solutions of electrolytes and alcohols were used. These solutes give surface tensions less than water (alcohols) and greater than water (electrolytes) and concentrations were chosen to produce solutions which, based on work in bubble columns and coalescence cells, can be considered partially-coalescing and non-coalescing. Regardless of surface tension, the bubble sizes in the non-coalescing solutions were approximately the same and much less than water, whilst those in the partiallycoalescing case where the surface tension was approximately equal to that of water, gave intermediate sizes. Thus, the Weber number cannot correlate such results. On the other hand, the concept of bubble sizes being controlled by coalescence-inhibitionafter initial break-up works well. In all cases, bubbles as small as 40 m were found and even in water some 40% were below 300 m, the smallest size practicably measurable by a capillary technique. Surprisingly, the bubble size decreased with vessel height and possible reasons for this are discussed.

VA Global Developmental Trend in Cognitive Processing Speed __ Children respond more slowly than young adults on a variety of information\u2010processing tasks. The global trend hypothesis posits that processing speed changes as a function of age, and that all component processes change at the same rate. A unique prediction of this hypothesis is that the overall response latencies of children of a particular age should be predictable from the latencies of young adults performing the same tasks\u2014without regard to the specific componential makeup of the task. The current effort tested this prediction by examining the performance of 4 age groups (10\u2010, 12\u2010, 15\u2010, and 19\u2010year\u2010olds) on 4 different tasks (choice reaction time, letter matching, mental rotation, and abstract matching). An analysis that simultaneously examined performance on all 4 tasks provided strong support for the global trend hypothesis. By plotting each child group's performance on all 4 tasks as a function of the young adult group's performance in the corresponding task conditions, precise linear functions were revealed: 10\u2010year\u2010olds were approximately 1.8 times slower than young adults on all tasks, and 12\u2010year\u2010olds were approximately 1.5 times slower, whereas 15\u2010year\u2010olds appeared to process information as fast as young adults.

VRegional Brain Activity during Different Paradigms of Mental Rotation in Healthy Volunteers: A Positron Emission Tomography Study __ Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to observe changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 10 right-handed healthy volunteers performing two paradigms of mental rotation. In one paradigm, subjects mentally rotated a single alphanumeric stimulus to determine whether it was shown in a normal or mirror-image position. In a second paradigm, subjects mentally rotated and compared pairs of figurative stimuli to determine whether the stimuli were identical or mirror-images. In both paradigms, rCBF was compared with a control task that used identical stimuli, but required no mental rotation. Mental rotation of single alphanumeric stimuli engendered activation in the primary somatomotor area in the left precentral gyrus. Mental rotation of paired figures engendered activation in the left superior parietal lobule and the right frontal medial gyrus. A deactivated area was located in the medial part of the left superior frontal gyrus. Comparison of both paradigms revealed that the left gyrus precentralis was activated significantly during the alphanumeric condition and that the left gyrus lingualis was significantly activated during the paired figures condition. Motor processes may be an inherent part of every mental rotation but the type of motor involvement appears strongly dependent on the specific task or the specific stimuli. Similar paradigms, designed to isolate the same cognitive function, in the same subjects, using the same imaging technology and methodology, but differing only in stimulus material, lead to different areas of neural activation. Task specificity determines the most significant changes in cerebral blood flow in different mental rotation paradigms.

VPhase behavior prediction of complex petroleum fluids __ The new phase behavior prediction method of petroleum fluids, which was recently developed by Manafi et al. for simple petroleum fluids, has been modified and extended for application to complex petroleum fluids. A combination of the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state for phase behavior prediction and the Riazi and Mansoori equation of state for density prediction has been applied. The proposed method is applicable for various equations of state as long as they give accurate prediction of phase behavior and densities of hydrocarbons and their mixtures. The composition of petroleum fluids is described by discrete and plus-fraction parts. For the plus-fraction of petroleum fluids, appropriate distribution functions for molecular mass, true boiling point and specific gravity are used. The distribution functions required an average value of molecular mass, and specific gravity of the plus-fraction as input data. Phase behavior calculations are performed for prediction of saturation pressure as well as flash liberation, differential liberation and flash-separation, in a wide range of pressures and temperatures for six different complex petroleum fluids and compared with experimental data. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can predict the phase behavior of complex petroleum fluids mixtures quite accurately.

VTwo\u2010week Test\u2010retest of the WAIS\u2010R and WMS\u2010R Subtests, the Purdue Pegboard, Trailmaking, and the Mental Rotation Test in Women __ This study investigated test\u2010retest over a 2\u2010week period in several common cognitive tests. These tests included some of the WAIS\u2010R and WMS\u2010R subtests, the Purdue Pegboard, Trailmaking, and the Mental Rotation Test (MRT). The sample consisted of 20 women with varied educational level and age. The subjects were administered the tests twice with a 2\u2010week interval. Practice effects and test\u2010retest reliability were examined. A total of 11 out of 14 of these tests showed a significant difference in score between testing sessions, with the MRT and Logical Memory subtest of the WMS\u2010R, Trailmaking, and the Arithmetic and Picture Completion demonstrating the largest practice effect. These results have direct application in studies that require short test\u2010retest periods, such as those examining drug effects and menstrual cycle variation in women.

VSELECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS PRODUCED SOLELY WITH APPETITIVE CONTINGENCIES: THE STIMULUS\u2010REINFORCER INTERACTION REVISITED __ In studies reporting stimulus\u2010reinforcer interactions in traditional conditioning paradigms, when a tone\u2010light compound was associated with food the light gained stimulus control, but when the compound was paired with shock avoidance the tone gained control. However, the physical nature of the reinforcerrelated events (food vs. shock) presented in the presence of the tone\u2010light compound was always confounded with the conditioned hedonic value of the compound's presence relative to its absence. When the compound was paired with shock, its presence was negative relative to its absence (which was shock\u2010free). In contrast, when the compound was paired with food, its presence was positive relative to its absence (which was food\u2010free). The present experiment dealt with this confounding effect by conditioning a tone\u2010light compound to be positive or negative, relative to its absence, solely with food reinforcement. One group of rats received food for responding in the presence of the tone\u2010light compound and no food in its absence. The other group also responded in the presence of the compound, but received food only in its absence. These rats were trained on a chained schedule in which responding in the presence of the tone\u2010light compound produced a terminal link signaled by the absence of the compound; responding ceased in the terminal link because it delayed food delivery. In a test session to assess stimulus control by the elements of the compound, tone and light were presented separately under extinction conditions. Rats that had been exposed to a positive correlation between food and the compound emitted almost double the responses in the presence of the light as in the presence of the tone. In comparison, rats that had been exposed to a negative correlation emitted only two thirds as many responses in the presence of the light as in the presence of the tone. Because this selective association was produced using only food, it appears that the contingencies under which a reinforcer is presented, rather than (or as well as) its physical properties, can generate the selective associations previously attributed to \u201cstimulus\u2010reinforcer interactions.\u201d This could mean that regardless of the class of reinforcer that ultimately maintains responding (appetitive or aversive), the contingency\u2010generated hedonic value of the compound stimulus may influence the dominant modality of stimulus control.

VDifferences in mucus and serum immunoglobulin of carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) __ Electrophoretic analysis did not reveal clear differences between skin mucus and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) of carp. The majority of both Igs were tetrameric (±760 kDa) and composed of 25 kDa light (L) chains and 70 kDa heavy (H) chains, but dimeric and monomeric forms were found as well. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) WCI 12 produced from serum Ig appeared to react with the H chain of both molecules. After immunisation of mice with purified mucus Ig, mAbs could be selected that were reactive with mucus Ig only. Two of these mAbs (WCI M1 and WCI M2) were immunoreactive with the H chain of mucus Ig and not or hardly immunoreactive with the H chain of serum Ig, indicating differences in the composition of the H chains of both molecules. Because WCI M2 appeared to recognize a carbohydrate determinant, differences seem to occur in the protein as well as carbohydrate composition of mucus and serum Ig. Flow cytometric results showed that both mAbs were reactive with the same subpopulation of WCI 12-positive B cells. Immunohistochemical reactions on cryosections also showed a limited reaction by these mAbs compared with WCI 12; only epithelium of skin and bile ducts and capillaries in the liver were strongly positive with these mAbs. The presence of mucus Ig at these locations is discussed. Our results indicate structural and functional differences between mucus and serum Ig, which may explain the mucosal immune responses reported for fish. Such a specific mucosal defense system can be very important for fish, living in a pathogenrich environment.

VInterdependence of Nonoverlapping Cortical Systems in Dual Cognitive Tasks __ One of the classic questions about human thinking concerns the limited ability to perform two cognitive tasks concurrently, such as a novice driver's difficulty in simultaneously driving and conversing. Limitations on the concurrent performance of two unrelated tasks challenge the tacitly assumed independence of two brain systems that seemingly have little overlap. The current study used fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure cortical activation during the concurrent performance of two high-level cognitive tasks that involve different sensory modalities and activate largely nonoverlapping areas of sensory and association cortex. One task was auditory sentence comprehension, and the other was the mental rotation of visually depicted 3-D objects. If the neural systems underlying the two tasks functioned independently, then in the dual task the brain activation in the main areas supporting the cognitive processing should be approximately the conjunction of the activation for each of the two tasks performed alone. We found instead that in the dual task, the activation in association areas (primarily temporal and parietal areas of cortex) was substantially less than the sum of the activation when the two tasks were performed alone, suggesting some mutual constraint among association areas. A similar result was obtained for sensory areas as well.

VFocal veno-occlusive lesions following metastasis of cancer in the liver with special reference to obstruction of lymphatics in hepatic veins __ Summary: Focal veno-occlusive lesions and congestion of the liver are found frequently at autopsy in patients with metastatic carcinoma in the liver. In 6 cases, intimal proliferation of loose connective tissue with dilatation of lymphatic capillaries was seen continuously from the terminal hepatic venule to the hepatic vein, and cancer cells were found only in lymphatic capillaries in the wall of the hepatic vein. In 7 cases, cancer cells infiltrated directly into the adventitia of the sublobular vein and intimai proliferation of loose connective tissue with or without formation of recent thrombi was observed. A main causative factor of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is thought to be leakage of plasma due to endothelial injury to the terminal hepatic venule and sublobular vein. Lymphatic obstruction, in addition to a direct reaction to invasion of cancer cells to the vessel wall, may also cause veno-occlusive lesions due to stasis and leakage of lymph fluid into the intima of the terminal hepatic venule, sublobular vein and hepatic vein.

VThe influence of spatial reference frames on imagined object- and viewer rotations __ The human visual system can represent an object's spatial structure with respect to multiple frames of reference. It can also utilize multiple reference frames to mentally transform such representations. Recent studies have shown that performance on some mental transformations is not equivalent: Imagined object rotations tend to be more difficult than imagined viewer rotations. We reviewed several related research domains to understand this discrepancy in terms of the different reference frames associated with each imagined movement. An examination of the mental rotation literature revealed that observers\u2019 difficulties in predicting an object\u2019s rotational outcome may stem from a general deficit with imagining the cohesive rotation of the object\u2019s intrinsic frame. Such judgments are thus more reliant on supplementary information provided by other frames, such as the environmental frame. In contrast, as assessed in motor imagery and other studies, imagined rotations of the viewer\u2019s relative frame are performed cohesively and are thus mostly immune to effects of other frames.

VNon\u2010invasive measurement of colonic blood flow distribution using laser Doppler imaging __ Background: This study tested a prototype laser Doppler scanner for the measurement of human colonic blood flow. Methods: Blood flow distribution was assessed in human colon during operation in six controls and in six patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing colectomy. Image processing software analysed several hundred reading points, expressing average flow in perfusion units. Results: Blood flow in the colon was not significantly lower in the control group than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (mean(s.e.m.) 297·8(24·5) versus347.2(59·0) perfusion units, P=0·12). Intestinal colonic mural blood supply was demonstrated up to a distance of 6 cm and ischaemia demarcation lines were identified before the onset of visible changes. Conclusion: This prototype laser Doppler flowscanner overcomes the previous limitations of laser Doppler flowmeters and may have many clinical and research applications. © 1998 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd

VEffects of a One-Hour Creative Dance Training on Mental Rotation Performance in Primary School Aged Children __ The study presented here investigated the influence of one-hour creative dance training on the spatial ability of mental rotation. Two groups of first and second graders solved a paper-pencil mental rotation test. Afterwards, one group received one lesson of creative dance training while the other group attended the regular physical education lesson. At the end of the short training period all children solved the mental rotation test again. The results show that the dance-training group improved their mental rotation performance more than the physical education group. This study expands our further studies where we have shown that five weeks of creative dance training enhances mental rotation performance (Jansen, Kellner, & Rieder, 2013). Further studies have to be conducted which investigate the short-term effects of different kinds of physical activity on different cognitive functions and their relation to academic performance.

VDynamic spatial cognition: Components, functions, and modifiability of body schema __ Abstract:\u2002 There has been substantial progress towards the understanding of the classical notion of \u201cbody schema,\u201d with recent advances in experimental methodology and techniques. Mental rotation of the hands can be used as a tool to investigate body schema. Research has shown that implicit motor imagery (i.e., mental simulated movements) can be generated based on the body schema, by combining both stored and incoming sensory information. Multimodal stimulation of peripersonal space has also served as an experimental paradigm for the study of body schema. Perception of peripersonal space is based on body\u2010part\u2010centered space coding that is considered as a manifestation of the body schema, its function being to integrate visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and perhaps motor plans as well. By combining such experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques, research has converged to show that the parietal association cortex and premotor cortex are important for the body schema. Multimodal perception of body parts and peripersonal space have been also studied in relation to prism adaptation and tool use effects, indicating a clear modifiability of the body schema. Following prolonged adaptation to reversed vision, a reversed hand representation can be added to the body schema like a tool. The stored component of the body schema may not be established well in young children. But once established it may not be deleted even after an arm is amputated, although it may be weakened. All of these findings help to specify properties of the body schema, its components, functions, and modifiabilities.

VDistribution of some Campanian and Maastrichtian macrofaunas in southeast Spain __ The distribution of Campanian-Maastrichtian species of inoceramids, ammonites, echinoids and brachiopods is given for 23 fossil sites in the Internal Prebetic and Intermediate Units of the Betic Range in Alicante province, southeast Spain. Six main units (1-6) are recognized in the stratigraphical sections used as a reference to correlate the fossil sites of the Internal Prebetic. Four different lithologies (A-D) are distinguished in the Quipar-Jorquera Formation, the only unit surveyed in the Late Cretaceous outcrops of the Intermediate Units. 57 inoceramid, 8 ammonite, 15 echinoid and 2 brachiopod taxa have been identified and are listed in a table indicating the relative positions of their appearances at each locality. Some biostratigraphical and palaeobiogeographical observations are made on the identified species of inoceramids, ammonites and echinoids.

VImagined transformations of bodies: an fMRI investigation __ A number of spatial reasoning problems can be solved by performing an imagined transformation of one\u2019s egocentric perspective. A series of experiments were carried out to characterize this process behaviorally and in terms of its brain basis, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a task contrast designed to isolate egocentric perspective transformations, participants were slower to make left-right judgments about a human figure from the figure\u2019s perspective than from their own. This transformation led to increased cortical activity around the left parietal-temporal-occipital junction, as well as in other areas including left frontal cortex. In a second task contrast comparing judgments about inverted figures to judgments about upright figures (always from the figure\u2019s perspective), participants were slower to make left-right judgments about inverted figures than upright ones. This transformation led to activation in posterior areas near those active in the first experiment, but weaker in the left hemisphere and stronger in the right, and also to substantial left frontal activation. Together, the data support the specialization of areas near the parietal-temporal-occipital junction for egocentric perspective transformations. These results are also suggestive of a dissociation between egocentric perspective transformations and object-based spatial transformations such as mental rotation.

VHuman acute toxicity prediction of the first 50 MEIC chemicals by a battery of ecotoxicological tests and physicochemical properties __ Five acute bioassays consisting of three cyst-based tests (with Artemia salina, Streptocephalus proboscideus and Brachionus calyciflorus), the Daphnia magna test and the bacterial luminescence inhibition test (Photobacterium phosphoreum) are used to determine the acute toxicity of the 50 priority chemicals of the Multicentre Evaluation of In Vitro Cytotoxicity (MEIC) programme. These tests and five physicochemical properties (n-octanol-water partition coefficient, molecular weight, melting point, boiling point and density) are evaluated either singly or in combination to predict human acute toxicity. Acute toxicity in humans is expressed both as oral lethal doses (HLD) and as lethal concentrations (HLC) derived from clinical cases. A comparison has also been made between the individual tests and the conventional rodent tests, as well as between rodent tests and the batteries resulting from partial least squares (PLS), with regard to their predictive power for acute toxicity in humans. Results from univariate regression show that the predictive potential of bioassays (both ecotoxicological and rodent tests) is generally superior to that of individual physicochemical properties for HLD. For HLC prediction, however, no consistent trend could be discerned that indicated whether bioassays are better estimators than physicochemical parameters. Generally, the batteries resulting from PLS regression seem to be more predictive than rodent tests or any of the individual tests. Prediction of HLD appears to be dependent on the phylogeny of the test species: cructaceans, for example, appear to be more important components in the test battery than rotifers and bacteria. For HLC prediction, one anostracan and one cladoceran crustacean are considered to be important. When considering both ecotoxicological tests and physicochemical properties, the battery based on the molecular weight and the cladoceran crustacean predicts HLC substantially better than any other combination.

VAdditive and multiplicative models for gamma distributed random variables, and their application as psychometric models for response times __ Abstract: A class of models for gamma distributed random variables is presented. These models are shown to be more flexible than the classical linear models with respect to the structure that can be imposed on the expected value. In particular, both additive, multiplicative, and combined additive-multiplicative models can be formulated. As a special case, a class of psychometric models for reaction times is presented, together with their psychological interpretation. By means of a comparison with existing models, this class of models is shown to offer some possibilities that are not available in existing methods. Parameter estimation by means of maximum likelihood (ML) is shown to have some attractive properties, since the models belong to the exponential family. Then, the results of a simulation study of the bias in the ML estimates are presented. Finally, the application of these models is illustrated by an analysis of the data from a mental rotation experiment. This analysis is preceded by an evaluation of the appropriateness of the gamma distribution for these data.

VHelicobacter pylori associated with a high prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease and a low prevalence of gastric cancer in a developing nation. __ This study examines the relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer--in particular, the presence or absence of bacteria, the grading of gastritis, and the degree of inflammation in the antral and oxyntic mucosae. The grading of gastritis and the detection of H pylori were determined by histology using the Sydney system. Of the 1006 patients examined, 34.5% had duodenal ulcer disease, 3.5% gastric ulcer disease, and 2% with coexistent ulceration. Most patients (50.2%) were classified as having non-ulcer dyspepsia. Altogether 2.4% of patients had gastric cancer and two further patients had carcinoma in the gastric stump. Of the ulcer disease patients, 87.2% had histological evidence of H pylori infection. After patients who had taken antibiotics or bismuth compounds in the preceding four weeks were excluded, 98.9% of the duodenal ulcer disease, 100% of the gastric ulcer disease, and 100% of the coexistent ulcer disease patients had evidence of H pylori infection. In patients with gastric cancer who had not taken antimicrobial agents in the four weeks before endoscopy, 83.3% had evidence of H pylori infection. Thus, there was a high rate of duodenal ulcer disease and a low rate of gastric ulcer disease in southern China, an area of low gastric cancer mortality. There was a specific topographical relationship between H pylori, the histological response, and gastroduodenal disease. Our data suggest that the status of a nation as either 'developed' or 'developing' can not be used to predict the upper gastrointestinal disease profile of its population.

VApplication of ZnO and poly\u2010Si in thin\u2010film heterostructures __ In this work, thin\u2010film heterojunction is prepared using ZnO and poly\u2010Si thin films and its I\u2013V characteristics are presented. ZnO thin films have been applied for device engineering in different heterostructures, as well. In this work, the I\u2013V characteristics of a thin\u2010film heterostructure n\u2010ZnO/poly\u2010Si are studied. The ZnO polycrystalline films are deposited by RF sputtering in an atmosphere of Ar on the surface of a p\u2010type poly\u2010Si layer. The poly\u2010Si films are prepared on glass substrate by the method of aluminum\u2010induced crystallization (AIC) from precursor layers of Al and a\u2010Si:H. The Al and a\u2010Si:H precursor films are deposited by magnetron sputtering on glass substrate. The a\u2010Si:H film precursors contain 9\u2009at% hydrogen. The isothermal annealing of the structure glass/Al/a\u2010Si:H is performed in forming gas (N2\u2009+\u20095%H2) in the temperature range of 530\u2013550\u2009°C for 7 and 21\u2009h. The properties of the films are studied by X\u2010ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, optical transmission and reflection, and Raman spectroscopy. The I\u2013V characteristics of the thin\u2010films heterostructure n\u2010ZnO/ poly\u2010Si show diode behavior and ideality factor of 2.95.The structure exhibits photosensitivity under illumination.

VCharacteristics that Influence Individuals' Preferences for Levels of Complexity in Interior Design Furnishings __ The purpose of this research was to examine whether gender as well as skills in math, art, and mental rotation is related to aesthetic preferences for interior design furnishings. Existing research determined that individuals differ in their aesthetic preferences and can be grouped as either having preference for complex, simple, a mixture of complex and simple, or no preference. One hundred and twenty\u2010eight subjects (49 males, 79 females) were administered an interior design preference test, a mental rotation test, and a questionnaire about previous math and art grades and skill level. Results indicated that complex preferrers were more frequently males and exhibited strong skills in mental rotation, art/drafting, and art history. Simple preferrers demonstrated weak skills in mental rotation, art/drafting, and art history and were more frequently female. Those with no preference were more frequently females with strong skills in math and art/drafting. The mixed\u2010preference group was represented equally by males and females, exhibiting strong math skills, but weak skills in mental rotation, art/drafting, and art history.

VCellulose\u2010Nanocomposites: Towards High Performance Composite Materials __ Summary: Strong cellulose fibres, e.g. flax and hemp, are increasingly used for composites. Despite substantial advantages, the tensile strength of these fibres is limited due to their complex structure and the unavoidable imperfections of the cell wall, inherent from growth or induced by processing. Essential improvements are possible by using highly crystalline cellulose fibrils (\u201cwhiskers\u201d) which can be isolated from the cell wall, thus eliminating the influence of adhesion and defects. Instead of complete fibrillation, which demands special time consuming processing, a partly fibrillation has been achieved by adapted textile finishing procedures which have the potential for mass production. By combining chemical and mechanical/hydro\u2010mechanical treatments it is possible to produce finest fibrils with diameters from below 1 µm down to the nanometer range. The problem of fibril agglomeration during drying has been avoided by forming homogenous fibrous sheets in a wet\u2010laid non\u2010woven process. These sheets can be impregnated with thermosetting resins. Alternatively thermoplastic polymers can be directly integrated to form hybrid materials ready for moulding. The resulting composites show greatly enhanced mechanical properties.

VHemispheric asymmetry of arterial blood flow velocity changes during verbal and visuospatial tasks __ Changes in arterial blood flow velocity induced by cognitive activity were measured by simultaneous bilateral transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) of the posterior and the middle cerebral artery. The finding of a robust left hemisphere dominance for verbal tasks but of an inconsistent right hemisphere dominance for visuospatial tasks obtained in earlier study [13], in which TCD measurement had been restricted to the middle cerebral arteries, was confirmed. At the same time, it could be demonstrated that the failure to find the expected right hemisphere dominance for tasks of spatial visualization and mental rotation extended to the TCD measurement of the posterior cerebral arteries.

VToxicology and risk assessment of coumarin: Focus on human data __ Coumarin is a secondary phytochemical with hepatotoxic and carcinogenic properties. For the carcinogenic effect, a genotoxic mechanism was considered possible, but was discounted by the European Food Safety Authority in 2004 based on new evidence. This allowed the derivation of a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for the first time, and a value of 0.1\u2009mg/kg body weight was arrived at based on animal hepatotoxicity data. However, clinical data on hepatotoxicity from patients treated with coumarin as medicinal drug is also available. This data revealed a subgroup of the human population being more susceptible for the hepatotoxic effect than the animal species investigated. The cause of the high susceptibility is currently unknown; possible mechanisms are discussed. Using the human data, a TDI of 0.1\u2009mg/kg body weight was derived, confirming that of the European Food Safety Authority. Nutritional exposure may be considerably, and is mainly due to use of cassia cinnamon, which is a popular spice especially, used for cookies and sweet dishes. To estimate exposure to coumarin during the Christmas season in Germany, a telephone survey was performed with more than 1000 randomly selected persons. Heavy consumers of cassia cinnamon may reach a daily coumarin intake corresponding to the TDI.

CD133, a cell surface antigen, was identified as a stem cell maker for human leukemia, brain tumors, and prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to detect the expression of CD133, a putative marker of cancer stem cells in the Hep\u20102 cell line, and isolate CD133 positive cells to observe their proliferation and differentiation ability in vitro. Method: Immunocytochemical staining technology and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of the putative stem cell marker CD133 in a Hep\u20102 cell line. The immunomagnetic beads were applied to purify CD133 positive cells. CD133+ tumor cells were cultured in vitro to observe their ability to proliferate and differentiate. Results: Only a small proportion (<5%) of cells in the Hep\u20102 cell line expressed CD133. CD133+ cells possess a marked capacity for self renewal, extensive proliferation, and mutilineal differentiation potency in vitro. Conclusion: CD133 is one of the markers for cancer stem cells in human laryngeal tumors, the Hep\u20102 cell line.

VA Parallel-Process Model of Mental Rotation __ It is argued that some of the phenomena identified with analog processes by Shepard can be understood as resulting from a parallel-process algorithm running on a processor having many individual processing elements and a restricted communication structure. In particular, an algorithm has been developed and implemented which models human behavior on Shepard's object rotation and comparison task. The algorithm exhibits computation times which increase linearly with the angle of rotation. Shepard found a similar linear function in his experiments with human subjects. In addition, the intermediate states of the computation are such that if the rotation process were to be interrupted at any point, the object representation would correspond to that of the actual object at a position along the rotation trajectory. The computational model presented here is governed by three constraining assumptions: (a) that it be parallel: (b) that the communication between processors be restricted to immediate neighbors: (c) that the object representation be distributed across a large fraction of the available processors. A method of diagnosing the correct axis of rotation is also presented.

VA New Set of Three-Dimensional Shapes for Investigating Mental Rotation Processes: Validation Data and Stimulus Set __ Mental rotation is one of the most influential paradigms in the history of cognitive psychology. In this paper, we present a new set of validated mental rotation stimuli to be used freely by the scientific community. Three-dimensional visual rendering software was employed to generate a total of 384 realistic-looking mental rotation stimuli with shading and foreshortening depth cues. Each stimulus was composed of two pictures: a baseline object and a target object, placed side by side, which can be aligned by means of a rotation around the vertical axis in half of the stimuli but not in the other half. Behavioral data (N=54, freely available) based on these stimuli exhibited the typical linear increase in response times and error rates with angular disparity, validating the stimulus set. This set of stimuli is especially useful for studies where it is necessary to avoid stimulus repetition, such as training studies.

VEffects of stimulus complexity on mental rotation rate of polygons __ Both spatial and propositional theories of imagery predict that the rate at which mental images can be rotated is slower the more complex the stimulus. Four experiments (three published and one unpublished) testing that hypothesis found no effect of complexity on rotation rate. It is argued that despite continued methodological improvements, subjects in the conditions of greater complexity may have found it sufficient to rotate only partial images, thereby vitiating the prediction. The two experiments reported here are based on the idea of making the discriminative response sufficiently difficult so as to force the rotation of complete images. The first one scaled the similarity between standard polygons and certain systematically mutated versions. From the ratings so obtained, two levels of perceived similarity, high and low, were defined and served as separate conditions in a response-time, image rotation experiment. The second experiment tested the complexity hypothesis by examining the effect of similarity on rotation rates and its interaction with levels of complexity. The results support the complexity hypothesis, but only for the highly similar stimuli. Rotation times were also generally slower for high as compared with low similarity. It is argued that these results arise because subjects rotate incomplete images when the stimuli are not very similar.

VThe effect of distinct mental strategies on classification performance for brain\u2013computer interfaces __ Motor imagery is the task most commonly used to induce changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals for mental imagery-based brain computer interfacing (BCI). In this study, we investigated EEG patterns that were induced by seven different mental tasks (i.e. mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, imagery of familiar faces and motor imagery) and evaluated the binary classification performance. The aim was to provide a broad range of reliable and user-appropriate tasks to make individual optimization of BCI control strategies possible. Nine users participated in four sessions of multi-channel EEG recordings. Mental tasks resulting most frequently in good binary classification performance include mental subtraction, word association, motor imagery and mental rotation. Our results indicate that a combination of \u2018brain-teasers\u2019 \u2013 tasks that require problem specific mental work (e.g. mental subtraction, word association) \u2013 and dynamic imagery tasks (e.g. motor imagery) result in highly distinguishable brain patterns that lead to an increased performance.

VMental rotation of anthropoid hands: a chronometric study __ It has been shown that mental rotation of objects and human body parts is processed differently in the human brain. But what about body parts belonging to other primates? Does our brain process this information like any other object or does it instead maximize the structural similarities with our homologous body parts? We tried to answer this question by measuring the manual reaction time (MRT) of human participants discriminating the handedness of drawings representing the hands of four anthropoid primates (orangutan, chimpanzee, gorilla, and human). Twenty-four right-handed volunteers (13 males and 11 females) were instructed to judge the handedness of a hand drawing in palm view by pressing a left/right key. The orientation of hand drawings varied from 0º (fingers upwards) to 90º lateral (fingers pointing away from the midline), 180º (fingers downwards) and 90º medial (finger towards the midline). The results showed an effect of rotation angle (F(3, 69) = 19.57, P < 0.001), but not of hand identity, on MRTs. Moreover, for all hand drawings, a medial rotation elicited shorter MRTs than a lateral rotation (960 and 1169 ms, respectively, P < 0.05). This result has been previously observed for drawings of the human hand and related to biomechanical constraints of movement performance. Our findings indicate that anthropoid hands are essentially equivalent stimuli for handedness recognition. Since the task involves mentally simulating the posture and rotation of the hands, we wondered if "mirror neurons" could be involved in establishing the motor equivalence between the stimuli and the participants' own hands.

VSeparating "Rotators" From "Nonrotators" in the Mental Rotations Test: A Multigroup Latent Class Analysis __ Items of mental rotation tests can not only be solved by mental rotation but also by other solution strategies. A multigroup latent class analysis of 24 items of the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was conducted in a sample of 1,695 German pupils and students to find out how many solution strategies can be identified for the items of this test. The results showed that five subgroups (latent classes) can be distinguished. Although three of the subgroups differ mainly in the number of items reached, one class shows are very low performance. In another class, a special solution strategy is used. This strategy seems to involve analytic rather than mental rotation processes and is efficient only for a special MRT item type, indicating that not all MRT items require a mental rotation approach. In addition, the multigroup analysis revealed significant sex differences with respect to the class assignment, confirming prior findings that on average male participants perform mental rotation tasks faster and better than female participants. Females were also overrepresented in the analytic strategy class. The results are discussed with respect to psychometric and substantive implications, and suggestions for the optimization of the MRT items are provided.

VSpatial Representation and Haptic Mental Rotation __ In this paper it is argued that it is legitimate to talk about mental imagery, and thus, to claim that spatial information is coded in an analogue mode. Evidence from research with blind people indicate that they can perform mental rotation and that analogue spatial cognition does not depend on visual information. It is therefore proposed that, if the blind can perform mental rotation in an analogue mode, there exists a common mode, for processing spatial information, which is not modality specific. The results of the presented study, which was conducted on eight blind subjects, and was intended to extend previous findings, was not conclusive. Reaction time of a haptic mental rotation task could not directly be shown to be a linear function of angular disparity. An alternative theory, based on two different cognitive strategies, is considered as an alternative explanation of the experimental results.

VWhat Does Physical Rotation Reveal About Mental Rotation? __ In a classic psychological science experiment, Shepard and Metzler (1971) discovered that the time participants took to judge whether two rotated abstract block figures were identical increased monotonically with the figures\u2019 relative angular disparity. They posited that participants rotate mental images to achieve a match and that mental rotation recruits motor processes. This interpretation has become central in the literature, but until now, surprisingly few researchers have compared mental and physical rotation. We had participants rotate virtual Shepard and Metzler figures mentally and physically; response time, accuracy, and real-time rotation data were collected. Results suggest that mental and physical rotation processes overlap and also reveal novel conclusions about physical rotation that have implications for mental rotation. Notably, participants did not rotate figures to achieve a match, but rather until they reached an off-axis canonical difference, and rotational strategies markedly differed for judgments of whether the figures were the same or different.

VImproving spatial abilities through mindfulness: Effects on the mental rotation task __ In this study, we demonstrate a previously unknown finding that mindful learning can improve an individual\u2019s spatial cognition without regard to gender differences. Thirty-two volunteers participated in the experiment. Baselines for spatial ability were first measured for the reaction time on the mental rotation task. Next, the participants were randomly assigned to either a mindful or mindless learning condition. After learning, the mental rotation task showed that those in the mindful learning condition responded faster than those in the mindless learning condition. This study provides promising evidence for applying mindful learning to education.

VDifferential Transfer of Learning: Effects of Instruction in Descriptive Geometry on Spatial Test Performance __ An important question in educational research is whether the imparting of knowledge and skills also improves pupils' intelligence. This aspect of transfer of learning is difficult to study within the framework of educational research. The longitudinal study presented here shows, based on sophisticated test materials and methods of analysis, that courses in Descriptive Geometry improve pupils' spatial ability, a primary dimension of intelligence. Also, sex differences that were clearly present at the first testing disappeared during "training" in Descriptive Geometry.

VThe Neural Bases of Strategy and Skill in Sentence\u2013Picture Verification __ This experiment used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to examine the relation between individual differences in cognitive skill and the amount of cortical activation engendered by two strategies (linguistic vs. visual\u2013spatial) in a sentence\u2013picture verification task. The verbal strategy produced more activation in language-related cortical regions (e.g., Broca's area), whereas the visual\u2013spatial strategy produced more activation in regions that have been implicated in visual\u2013spatial reasoning (e.g., parietal cortex). These relations were also modulated by individual differences in cognitive skill: Individuals with better verbal skills (as measured by the reading span test) had less activation in Broca's area when they used the verbal strategy. Similarly, individuals with better visual\u2013spatial skills (as measured by the Vandenberg, 1971, mental rotation test) had less activation in the left parietal cortex when they used the visual-spatial strategy. These results indicate that language and visual\u2013spatial processing are supported by partially separable networks of cortical regions and suggests one basis for strategy selection: the minimization of cognitive workload.

VSpatial abilities of expert clinical anatomists: Comparison of abilities between novices, intermediates, and experts in anatomy __ Spatial ability has been found to be a good predictor of success in learning anatomy. However, little research has explored whether spatial ability can be improved through anatomy education and experience. This study had two aims: (1) to determine if spatial ability is a learned or inherent facet in learning anatomy and (2) to ascertain if there is any difference in spatial ability between experts and novices in anatomy. Fifty participants were indentified: 10 controls, 10 novices, 10 intermediates, and 20 experts. Participants completed four computerized spatial ability tasks, a visual mental rotation task, categorical spatial judgment task, metric spatial task, and an image\u2010scanning task. The findings revealed that experts (P = 0.007) and intermediates (P = 0.016) were better in the metric spatial task than novices in terms of making more correct spatial judgments. Experts (P = 0.033), intermediates (P = 0.003), and novices (P = 0.004) were better in the categorical spatial task than controls in terms of speed of responses. These results suggest that certain spatial cognitive abilities are especially important and characteristic of work needed in clinical anatomy, and that education and experience contribute to further development of these abilities.

VAsthma Presentations to Emergency Departments in Western Sydney during the January 1994 Bushfires __ Smith M A (Western Sector Public Health Unit, 13 New St, Parramatta Nth, 2151, Sydney, Australia), Jalaludin B, Byles J E, Lim L and Leader S R. Asthma presentations to emergency departments in western Sydney during the January 1994 bushfires. International Journal of Epidemiology 1996; 25: 1227\u20131236. Background From 5 to 12 January 1994, the state of New South Wales suffered from the worst bushfires seen this century. High levels of particulate air pollution were recorded in western Sydney from 7 to 14 January 1994, with nephelometry readings reaching 10.24 \u03b2scat (10\u22124/m) and particulate matter <10 \u03bc readings peaking at 250.00 \u03bcg/m3. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an increase in the proportion of asthma presentations to emergency departments (ED) in western Sydney as a result of the bushfire-generated particulate air pollution. Method We retrospectively analysed the emergency room attendance books for asthma presentations from seven public hospitals serving the Western Sydney and Wentworth Health Areas over two 6\u20137 week periods, 17 December 1992 to 31 January 1993, and 17 December 1993 to 31 January 1994. Air pollution and meteorological data were obtained from local monitoring stations. Results The difference in the proportion of all ED presentations that were due to asthma during the week of the bushfire-generated air pollution, compared with the same week 12 months before, after adjusting for baseline changes over the 12-month period, was 0.0067 (95% Cl : \u22120.0007, 0.0141). The maximum daily nephelometry reading was not a significant predictor of the daily number of asthma presentations to ED in any of the Poisson regression models. Conclusions The bushfire-generated particulate air pollution in January 1994 did not result in an increase in asthma presentations to ED in western Sydney.

VA redrawn Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotations test: different versions and factors that affect performance. __ The available versions of the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) Mental Rotations Test (MRT) have physically deteriorated because only copies of copies are available. We report results from a redrawn version of the MRT and for alternate versions of the test. Males perform better than females, and students drawn from the physical sciences perform better than students drawn from the social sciences and humanities, confirming other reports with the original version of the MRT. Subjects find it very hard to perform the MRT when stimuli require rotation along both the top/bottom axis and the left/right axis. The magnitude of effect sizes for sex (which account, on average, for some 20% of the variance) does not increase with increasing difficulty of the task. Minimal strategy effects were observed and females did not perform differently during the menstrual period as opposed to the days between the menstrual periods. Practice effects are dramatic, confirming other reports with the original MRT, and can also be shown to be powerful in a transfer for practice paradigm, where test and retest involve different versions of the MRT. Main effects of handedness on MRT performance were not found.

VPerspective-taking vs. mental rotation transformations and how they predict spatial navigation performance __ In Experiment 1, participants completed one of two versions of a computerized pointing direction task that used the same stimuli but different spatial transformation instructions. In the perspective-taking version, participants were to imagine standing at one location facing a second location and then to imagine pointing to a third location. In the array-rotation version, participants saw a vector pointing to one location, were to imagine the second vector with the same base as the first pointing to a second location, to mentally rotate the two vectors, and finally to indicate the direction of the imagined vector after the rotation. In Experiment 2, participants completed the perspective-taking, mental rotation, and four large-scale navigational tasks. The results showed that the perspective-taking task required unique spatial transformation ability from the array rotation task, and the perspective-taking task predicted unique variance over the mental rotation task in navigational tasks that required updating self-to-object representations

VMicrostructured polymers via photopolymerization of non-aqueous organized solutions __ Structurally organized solutions containing monomers in an ethylene glycol (EG) medium were formed and polymerized to produce polymeric solids with various morphologies, and also unique thermal and mechanical properties. Previous research had demonstrated the formation of microemulsions in an aqueous medium containing methyl methacrylate (MMA) and acrylic acid (AA). However, the non-aqueous mixtures of MMA and AA with EG did not yield conventional microemulsions. Molecularly dispersed solutions were formed in the bulk of the phase diagram, while compositions closer to the demixing line exhibited critical behaviour. This paper presents the first account of the use of mixtures exhibiting critical behaviour to produce microstructured polymers. The non-aqueous mixtures did not form any well defined microstructures on polymerization for compositions away from the two-phase boundary. Compositions exhibiting critical behaviour yielded open cell structures and also beaded polymers at high EG contents. This suggests that the microstructure in these mixtures is preserved in the final polymer to a considerable extent. The virgin polymers containing EG had very low glass transition temperatures due to the plasticizing nature of EC. The plasticizing nature of EG was also evidenced in the tensile properties of the virgin polymers.

VKinetics of tritium isotope exchange between liquid pyrrole and gaseous hydrogen __ Abstract: The kinetics of tritium isotope exchange between liquid pyrrole and gaseous hydrogen has been studied over the temperature range of 290\u2013303 K. The reaction was carried out in the presence of platinum black but in spite of that, it appeared to be relatively slow. The kinetics of the exchange reaction studied could be described by the simple McKay equation. The results obtained suggest that diffusion is the rate-determining step. A mechanism of exchange is proposed.

VDoes Aid for Education Educate Children? Evidence from Panel Data __ Most of the aid effectiveness literature has focused on the potential growth effects of aggregate aid, with inconclusive results. Considering that donors have repeatedly stressed the multidimensionality of their objectives, a more disaggregated view on aid effectiveness is warranted. The impact of aid on education is analyzed empirically for almost 100 countries over 19702004. The effectiveness of sector-specific aid is assessed within the framework of social production functions. The Millennium Development Goals related to education, particularly the goal of achieving universal primary school enrollment, are considered as outcome variables. The analysis suggests that higher per capita aid for education significantly increases primary school enrollment, while increased domestic government spending on education does not. This result is robust to the method of estimation, the use of instruments to control for the endogeneity of aid, and the set of control variables included in the estimations.

VIntegrating cognitive psychology, neurology and neuroimaging __ In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in research effectively integrating cognitive psychology, functional neuroimaging, and behavioral neurology. This new work is typically conducting basic research into aspects of the human mind and brain. The present review features as examples of such integrations two series of studies by the author and his colleagues. One series, employing object recognition, mental motor imagery, and mental rotation paradigms, clarifies the nature of a cognitive process, imagined spatial transformations used in shape recognition. Among other implications, it suggests that when recognizing a hand's handedness, imagining one's body movement depends on cerebrally lateralized sensory-motor structures and deciding upon handedness depends on exact match shape confirmation. The other series, using cutaneous, tactile, and auditory pitch discrimination paradigms, elucidates the function of a brain structure, the cerebellum. It suggests that the cerebellum has non-motor sensory support functions upon which optimally fine sensory discriminations depend. In addition, six key issues for this integrative approach are reviewed. These include arguments for the value and greater use of: rigorous quantitative meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies; stereotactic coordinate-based data, as opposed to surface landmark-based data; standardized vocabularies capturing the elementary component operations of cognitive and behavioral tasks; functional hypotheses about brain areas that are consistent with underlying microcircuitry; an awareness that not all brain areas implicated by neuroimaging or neurology are necessarily directly involved in the associated cognitive or behavioral task; and systematic approaches to integrations of this kind.

VHuman male infertility: chromosome anomalies, meiotic disorders, abnormal spermatozoa and recurrent abortion __ Human male infertility is often related to chromosome abnormalities. In chromosomally normal infertile males, the rates of chromosome 21 and sex chromosome disomy in spermatozoa are increased. Higher incidences of trisomy 21 (seldom of paternal origin) and sex chromosome aneuploidy are also found. XXY and XYY patients produce increased numbers of XY, XX and YY spermatozoa, indicating an increased risk of production of XXY, XYY and XXX individuals. Since XXYs can reproduce using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), this could explain the slight increase of sex chromosome anomalies in ICSI series. Carriers of structural reorganizations produce unbalanced spermatozoa, and risk having children with duplications and/or deficiencies. In some cases, this risk is considerably lower or higher than average. These patients also show increased diploidy, and a higher risk of producing diandric triploids. Meiotic disorders are frequent in infertile males, and increase with severe oligoasthenozoospemia (OA) and/or high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations. These patients produce spermatozoa with autosomal and sex chromosome disomies, and diploid spermatozoa. Their contribution to recurrent abortion depends on the production of trisomies, monosomies and of triploids. The most frequent sperm chromosome anomaly in infertile males is diploidy, originated by either meiotic mutations or by a compromised testicular environment.

VRemembering What But Not Where: Independence of Spatial and Visual Working Memory in the Human Brain __ We report the neuropsychological and MRI investigation of a patient (MV) who developed a selective impairment of visual-spatial working memory (WM) with preservation not only of verbal, but also of visual shape WM, following an ischemic lesion in the cerebral territory supplied by one of the terminal branches of the right anterior cerebral artery. MV was defective in visual-spatial WM whether the experimental procedure involved arm movement for target pointing or not. Also, in agreement with the role generally assigned to visual-spatial WM in visual imagery, MV was extremely slow in the mental rotation of visually and verbally presented objects. In striking contrast with the WM deficit, MV's visual-spatial long-term memory was intact. The behavioral and neuroanatomical investigation of MV provides support for the hypothesis that the superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) and the dorsomedial cortex of the parietal lobe (BA 7) are part of the neural circuitry underlying visual-spatial WM in humans.

VSize does matter: Women mentally rotate large objects faster than men __ Performance in a computerized \u201cmental rotation\u201d task was measured in groups of males and females while they rotated Shepard\u2010Metzler\u2010like cube assemblies on either a standard laptop screen (size = 36 cm) or on a large display wall (584 cm) where the stimuli appeared at considerably larger sizes and within a much wider field of view than that typically used in most spatial tasks. Males and females did not differ significantly in performance in the standard size condition with regards to response time but females performed faster than males in the large display condition. Males were also found to be significantly more accurate than females, regardless of display. We found no sign of trading accuracy for speed for either of the sexes or screen size conditions. We surmise that such an effect may be due to differences in task\u2010solving strategies between the sexes, where a holistic strategy \u2013 which may be preferred by males is negatively affected by large object sizes, whereas a piecemeal approach, that may be preferred by females, is virtually unaffected by display size.

VClass, Capital and Crisis: A Return to Fundamentals __ The financial crisis that currently threatens the stability of global capitalism is the latest in a long line of similar episodes stretching back some 200 years. While many orthodox economists explain the crisis in terms of the failure of the proper operation of the market mechanism, radical accounts see crisis as an aspect of the constitution of capital and of the process of the accumulation of capital itself. This article explores the extent to which Marx's understanding of accumulation and crisis can provide the basis for a general theory of capitalist crisis. It concludes that the growing and chronic separation between financial (fictitious) accumulation and productive accumulation is the key to understanding the latest crisis of capital expressed as a global credit crunch. Furthermore, Marx opens the door to the development of an overtly \u2018political\u2019 theory of crisis stressing the \u2018capitalist use of crisis\u2019 as a means for the violent reassertion of the fundamental class relation.

VCompleteness of response and quality of life in mood and anxiety disorders __ Mental health care has traditionally focused on the need to document relief of specific symptoms of a psychiatric disorder, as well as how the patient functions in social roles. Recently, there has been increased attention paid to the issue of quality of life (QOL) and psychiatric illness. There has been a growing recognition that different treatment options may vary in their effects on the patient\u2019s ability to function in multiple life domains. Studies focusing on the QOL in patients suffering from mood and anxiety disorders have become more prevalent. Depression and anxiety disorders impose a substantial cost on society in terms of both psychiatric service costs as well as the loss of the individual to society through lost work production. However, a change in the severity of depression or anxiety often correlates with a change in disability and health service utilization. Lately, there have been a number of treatment studies of anxiety and depressive disorders that have examined the effect of treatment on QOL. Although treatment may reduce the severity and frequency of target symptoms, the patient\u2019s assessment of QOL helps to differentiate a true treatment response and remission from a partial response. The evaluation of what constitutes an adequate treatment response or remission is complicated and likely requires multiple assessment instruments in order to develop a complete understanding. In both anxiety and depressive disorders, the patient suffers from impaired functioning, which results in increased healthcare utilization.

VStereotypes and Steroids: Using a Psychobiosocial Model to Understand Cognitive Sex Differences __ To further our understanding of cognitive sex differences, we studied the relationship between menstrual phase (via serum estradiol and progesterone levels) and cognitive abilities and cognitive performance in a sample of medical students in eastern Turkey. As expected, we found no sex differences on the Cattell \u201cCulture Fair Intelligence Test\u201d (a figural reasoning test), with females scoring significantly higher on a Turkish version of the Finding A's Test (rapid word knowledge) and males scoring significantly higher on a paper-and-pencil mental rotation test. The women showed a slight enhancement on the Finding A's Test and a slight decrement in Cattell scores during the preovulatory phase of their cycle that (probably) coincided with a rise in estrogen. There were also small cycle-related enhancements in performance for these women on the mental rotation test that may reflect cyclical increases in estrogen and progesterone. Additional analyses showed an inverted U-shaped function in level of estradiol and the Cattell Test. Finally, for women who were tested on Day 10 of their menstrual cycle, there was a negative linear relationship between their Cattell scores and level of progesterone. Stereotypes about the cognitive abilities of males and females did not correspond to performance on the mental rotation or Finding A's Test, so the sex-typical results could not be attributed to either stereotype threat or stereotype activation. For practical purposes, hormone-related effects were generally small. Variations over the menstrual cycle do not provide evidence for a \u201csmarter\u201d sex, but they do further our understanding of steroidal action on human cognitive performance.

VSex differences in spatial ability in children __ Abstract: There is considerable evidence that sex differences in spatial ability exist in adults, with males outperforming females at every age after puberty. It is difficult, however, to find sex differences in children younger than 13. This is due in part to the lack of adequate measures of spatial ability for use with children. We report the use of spatial tests for children that are similar to those that have shown large sex differences in adults and may be measuring ability comparable to adult spatial ability. Four tests of mental rotation and spatial visualization were given to two samples of children. The first sample consisted of 81 children (39 males and 42 females) aged 9 to 12 years. The second sample consisted of 42 children (21 males and 21 females) aged 9 to 13 years. Sex differences of .4\u2013.6 standard deviations were found on three tests in both samples. These results indicate that sex differences in spatial ability can be found in preadolescents if appropriate tests are used. Measurement of these abilities in children facilitates the investigation of possible biological and sociocultural contributors to the sex differences in spatial ability.

VSingular stress fields in interfacial notches of hybrid metal matrix composites __ This paper presents results from a study on the singular stress fields in metal matrix composites in which dual matrices exist. The adjoining metallic matrices flanking the interface can deform plastically with powerlaw strain hardening. These matrices may have both different hardening exponents and different yield strengths. An asymptotic analysis coupled with numerical eigen-analysis solved the spatial structure of the singular stress field at radial- and angular-dependent parts: \u03c3ij\u223cr\u03bb \u03c3 \u0303ij(\u03b8). The dependence of the strength of the singular stresses on the matrix properties is discussed. The effects of local geometry on the nature of singular stresses are addressed. Highlights for interfacial notches are reported here. The drivers for this study are interfacial notches and free-edges in hybrid metal matrix composites (Fig. 1). However, the results can also be applied to other advanced structures which are composed of two or more distinct components or phases such as bone-implant interfaces and surface mounts in electronic packages[1].

VEffects of a Ginkgo biloba extract on forearm haemodynamics in healthy volunteers __ The aim was to validate possible vasodilating effects of a Ginkgo biloba extract with a secondary aim of finding a pharmacodynamic signal relating to the active component of these extracts. We studied the effect of G. biloba extract on forearm haemodynamics in 16 healthy subjects (nine females, seven males) with a median age of 32 years (range: 21\u201347). The study was conducted as a randomized, double\u2010blinded cross\u2010over design using oral treatment with G. biloba extract (Gibidyl Forte® t.i.d. or placebo for 6 weeks. Forearm blood flow and venous capacity were measured by strain\u2010gauge plethysmography. Blood pressure was measured by standard sphygmomanometry, and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) was derived. Measurements were made at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks of treatment. Forearm blood flow was significantly higher during active treatment after 3 and 6 weeks as compared with placebo treatment for 3 and 6 weeks (P<0·05). Mean arterial blood pressure was unchanged, making the calculated FVR significantly lower during active treatment (P<0·02). It is concluded that oral treatment with a G. biloba extract (Gibidyl Forte®) is able to dilate forearm blood vessels causing increments in regional blood flow without changing blood pressure levels in healthy subjects. The increments in blood flow may be used as a biological signal for pharmacokinetic studies.

VA Hemispheric Division of Labor Aids Mental Rotation __ In the present study, we investigated whether a hemispheric division of labor is most advantageous to performance when lateralized inputs place unequal resource demands on the left and right cerebral hemispheres. In each trial, participants decided whether 2 rotated letters, presented either in the same visual field (within-field trials) or in opposite visual fields (across-field trials), were both of normal orientation, or whether one was normal and the other was mirror-reversed. To discriminate a letter's orientation, one must rotate the letter to the upright position. Therefore, we manipulated whether the two letters imposed similar or dissimilar demands on cognitive resources by varying the number of degrees that each letter needed to be rotated to reach the upright position. As predicted, in 2 experiments we found that the across-field advantage increased as the number of degrees each letter needed to be rotated became more dissimilar. These findings support a current model of hemispheric interactions, which posits that an unequal hemispheric distribution of cognitive load allows the cerebral hemispheres to take the lead for different aspects of cognitive processing.

VThe Role of Mental Rotation in Letter Processing by Children and Adults __ Children and adults identified or discriminated the version (normal or backwards) of letters presented in 10 different orientations between 0 and 180 degrees. Reaction time to discriminate version increased linearly with orientation for both children and adults, but reaction time to identify was not strongly influenced by orientation for either children or adults. This suggests that both children and adults mentally rotate a representation of the letter to discriminate version, but that neither children nor adults rotate letters to identify them.

VSpatial Rotation and Perspective taking Abilities in Relation to Performance in Reflective Symmetry Tasks __ The aim of this study is to examine the role of students' spatial rotation and perspective taking abilities and their performance on reflective symmetry tasks. The study was conducted with 10-12 year old students. The results suggest that students' mathematical performance in reflective symmetry tasks can be predicted by students' general mathematical achievement, perspective taking abilities and spatial rotation abilities, in descending order of importance. Thus, whereas general mathematical ability was the most important predictor for reflective symmetry tasks, perspective taking ability was more related to symmetry performance than spatial rotation. Additionally, gender and grade level were not found to be related to performance in symmetry.

VCapacity for Visual Features in Mental Rotation __ Although mental rotation is a core component of scientific reasoning, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. For instance, how much visual information can someone rotate at once? We asked participants to rotate a simple multipart shape, requiring them to maintain attachments between features and moving parts. The capacity of this aspect of mental rotation was strikingly low: Only one feature could remain attached to one part. Behavioral and eye-tracking data showed that this single feature remained ''glued'' via a singular focus of attention, typically on the object's top. We argue that the architecture of the human visual system is not suited for keeping multiple features attached to multiple parts during mental rotation. Such measurement of capacity limits may prove to be a critical step in dissecting the suite of visuospatial tools involved in mental rotation, leading to insights for improvement of pedagogy in science-education contexts.

VImagined rotations of self versus objects: an fMRI study __ This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying two types of spatial transformations: imagined object rotations and imagined rotations of the self about an object. Participants viewed depictions of single three-dimensional Shepard\u2013Metzler objects situated within a sphere. A T-shaped prompt appeared outside of the sphere at different locations across trials. In the object rotation task, participants imagined rotating the object so that one of its ends was aligned with the prompt. They then judged whether a textured portion of the object would be visible in its new orientation. In the self rotation task, they imagined rotating themselves to the location of the T-prompt, and then judged whether a textured portion of the object would be visible from the new viewpoint. Activation in both tasks was compared to respective control conditions in which identical judgments were made without rotation. A direct comparison of self and object rotation tasks revealed activation spreading from left premotor to left primary motor (M1) cortex (areas 6/4) for imagined object rotations, but not imagined self rotations. In contrast, the self rotation task activated left supplementary motor area (SMA; area 6). In both transformations, activation also occurred in other regions. These findings provide evidence for multiple spatial-transformation mechanisms within the human cognitive system.

VTraining generalized spatial skills __ Spatial transformation skills are an essential aspect of cognitive ability. These skills can be improved by practice, but such improvement has usually been specific to tasks and stimuli. The present study investigated whether intensive long-term practice leads to change that transcends stimulus and task parameters. Thirty-one participants (14 male, 17 female) were tested on three cognitive tasks: a computerized version of the Shepard\u2013Metzler (1971) mental rotation task (MRT), a mental paper-folding task (MPFT), and a verbal analogies task (VAT). Each individual then participated in daily practice sessions with the MRT or the MPFT over 21 days. Postpractice comparisons revealed transfer of practice gains to novel stimuli for the practiced task, as well as transfer to the other, nonpracticed spatial task. Thus, practice effects were process based, not instance based. Improvement in the nonpracticed spatial task was greater than that in the VAT; thus, improvement was not merely due to greater ease with computerized testing.

VHuman motor cortex activity during mental rotation __ The functional role of human premotor and primary motor cortex during mental rotation has been studied using functional MRI at 3 T. Fourteen young, male subjects performed a mental rotation task in which they had to decide whether two visually presented cubes could be identical. Exploratory Fuzzy Cluster Analysis was applied to identify brain regions with stimulus-related time courses. This revealed one dominant cluster which included the parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that showed signal enhancement during the whole stimulus presentation period, reflecting cognitive processing. A second cluster, encompassing the contralateral primary motor cortex, showed activation exclusively after the button press response. This clear separation was possible in 3 subjects only, however. Based on these exploratory results, the hypothesis that primary motor cortex activity was related to button pressing only was tested using a parametric approach via a random-effects group analysis over all 14 subjects in SPM99. The results confirmed that the stimulus response via button pressing causes activation in the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area are recruited for the actual mental rotation process.

VImplicit transfer of motor strategies in mental rotation __ Recent research indicates that motor areas are activated in some types of mental rotation. Many of these studies have required participants to perform egocentric transformations of body parts or whole bodies; however, motor activation also has been found with nonbody objects when participants explicitly relate the objects to their hands. The current study used positron emission tomography (PET) to examine whether such egocentric motor strategies can be transferred implicitly from one type of mental rotation to another. Two groups of participants were tested. In the Hand\u2013Object group, participants performed imaginal rotations of pictures of hands; following this, they then made similar judgments of pictures of Shepard\u2013Metzler objects. The Object\u2013Object group performed the rotation task for two sets of Shepard\u2013Metzler objects only. When the second condition in each group (which always required rotating Shepard\u2013Metzler objects) was compared, motor areas (Area 6 and M1) were found to be activated only in the Hand\u2013Object group. These findings suggest that motor strategies can be covertly transferred to imaginal transformations of nonbody objects.

VDizzy people perform no worse at a motor imagery task requiring whole body mental rotation; a case-control comparison __ We wanted to find out whether people who suffer from dizziness take longer than people who do not, to perform a motor imagery task that involves implicit whole body rotation. Our prediction was that people in the ''dizzy'' group would take longer at a left/right neck rotation judgment task but not a left/right hand judgment task, because actually performing the former, but not the latter, would exacerbate their dizziness. Secondly, we predicted that when dizzy participants responded to neck rotation images, responses would be greatest when images were in the upside down orientation; an orientation with greatest dizzy-provoking potential. To test this idea, we used a case-control comparison design. One hundred and eighteen participants who suffered from dizziness and 118 age, gender, arm pain, and neck pain-matched controls took part in the study. Participants undertook two motor imagery tasks; a left/right neck rotation judgment task and a left/right hand judgment task. The tasks were completed using the Recognise program; an online reaction time task program. Images of neck rotation were shown in four different orientations; 0° , 90° , 180° , and 270° . Participants were asked to respond to each \u201cneck\u201d image identifying it as either \u201cright neck rotation\u201d or a ''left neck rotation,'' or for hands, a right or a left hand. Results showed that participants in the ''dizzy'' group were slower than controls at both tasks (p = 0.015), but this was not related to task (p = 0.498). Similarly, ''dizzy'' participants were not proportionally worse at images of different orientations (p = 0.878). Our findings suggest impaired performance in dizzy people, an impairment that may be confined to motor imagery or may extend more generally.

VStimulus and Sex-Differences in Performance of Mental Rotation - Evidence from Event-Related Potentials __ We examined stimulus and sex differences in reaction time (RT) and event-related potentials (ERPs) during mental rotation of letters and abstract designs (PMA figures). RTs replicated stimulus and angle effects found in previous studies, but no sex differences were found for either set of stimuli. ERP latency data showed women began stimulus evaluation earlier, and PMA rotations began later over smaller angles, whereas letter rotations began later over larger angles. ERP amplitude data replicated hemisphere, electrode, and angle effects found in earlier studies. Amplitude measures also showed greater involvement of anterior cortical areas for evaluation of letter figures and posterior right temporal lobe for PMA figures, and greater positivity of womens waveforms than mens over late evaluation and early rotation components.

VRe-Evaluation of M-LAO, L-Amino Acid Oxidase, from the Venom of Gloydius blomhoffi as an Anticoagulant Protein __ Many anticoagulant proteins have been found from snake venoms. Recently, L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) from the venom of Gloydius blomhoffi, M-LAO, was reported to inhibit coagulation factor IX; however, the mechanism of its anticoagulant activity is still unclear. Here, we re-evaluated the anticoagulant activity of M-LAO. We first purified M-LAO from the venom of G. blomhoffi, and examined the effect of LAO inhibitors and the hydrogen peroxide scavenger, catalase, on the anticoagulant activity of M-LAO. We found that the isolated M-LAO fraction prolongs the APTT, PT and fibrinogen clotting time and cleaves the A-chain of fibrinogen. LAO inhibitors or catalase did not inhibit these effects. Detailed analysis revealed that the M-LAO fraction contained a small amount of 39-kDa metalloproteinase. The prolongation of clotting time and degradation of fibrinogen were inhibited by a metalloproteinase inhibitor. Therefore, we concluded that the anticoagulant activity of the M-LAO fraction was caused by the 39-kDa metalloproteinase.

VSegregation of a paternal insertional translocation results in partial 4q monosomy or 4q trisomy in two siblings __ A genetics evaluation was requested for a 6\u2010week\u2010old infant with multiple congenital malformations including mild craniofacial anomalies, truncal hypotonia, hypospadias, and a ventriculoseptal defect. Blood obtained for chromosome analysis revealed an abnormal chromosome 4. Paternal chromosome analysis showed a 46,XY, inv ins (3;4) (p21.32; q25q21.2), inv(4)(p15.3q21.2) karyotype. Therefore, the proband's chromosome 4 was the unbalanced product of this insertional translocation from the father resulting in partial monosomy 4q. Additionally, the derivative 4 had a pericentric inversion which was also seen in the father's chromosome 4. During genetic counseling, the proband's 2\u2010year\u2010old brother was evaluated. He was not felt to be abnormal in appearance, but was described as having impulsive behavior. Chromosome analysis on this child revealed 46,XY,der(3)inv ins(3;4)(p21.32;q25q21.2)pat. This karyotype results in partial trisomy 4q. FISH using two\u2010color \u201cpainting\u201d probes for chromosomes 3 and 4 confirmed the G\u2010banded interpretation in this family. The segregation seen in this family resulted in both reciprocal products being observed in the two children, with partial 4q monosomy showing multiple congenital anomalies, and partial 4q trisomy showing very few phenotypic abnormalities. © 1995 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VWhat explains rural-urban differentials in child mortality in Brazil? __ This paper presents an analysis of differentials in child survival by rural-urban place of residence in Brazil and examines the hypothesis that observed mortality differentials by place of residence are merely manifestations of underlying differences in socioeconomic status and demographic and reproductive behavior. The child mortality data come from the 1986 Demographic and Health Survey of Brazil and supplementary community-level variables are obtained from a database assembled by the Brazilian federal statistical agency. Child mortality rates are substantially and significantly lower in urban areas of Brazil. Our results suggest, however, that the urban advantage does not simply reflect underlying differences in socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics at the individual and household levels; rather, community variables appear to play an independent and important role. We also find that the effects of community characteristics on child survival are moderated by household socioeconomic factors, especially maternal education. Differences in socioeconomic characteristics are therefore important in explaining rural-urban child mortality differentials, but not in the way hypothesized by previous researchers.

VFamily handedness as a predictor of mental rotation ability among minority girls in a math-science training program __ Right-handed girls from nonright-handed families outperformed the other groups of minority adolescent girls enrolled in a science and technology program on a test of mental rotation ability. This target group excelled over right-handed girls with all right-handed relatives and nonright-handers. The pattern of group differences in mental rotation ability found here is consistent with those found for women with math-science training at the college level. The minority boys in the program outperformed the girls as a whole, but did not differ significantly from the right-handed girls with nonright-handed relatives. The present findings provide further support for the generality of Annett's genetic theory of handedness and brain organization, and for the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in accounting for individual differences in mental rotation ability.

VTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation of Primary Motor Cortex Affects Mental Rotation __ Neuroimaging studies have shown that motor structures are activated not only during overt motor behavior but also during tasks that require no overt motor behavior, such as motor imagery and mental rotation. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the primary motor cortex is needed for mental rotation by using single- pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the representation of the hand in left primary motor cortex while participants performed mental rotation of pictures of hands and feet. Relative to a peripheral magnetic stimulation control condition, response times (RTs) were slower when TMS was delivered at 650 ms but not at 400 ms after stimulus onset. The magnetic stimulation effect at 650 ms was larger for hands than for feet. These findings demonstrate that (i) activation of the left primary motor cortex has a causal role in the mental rotation of pictures of hands; (ii) this role is stimulus-specific because disruption of neural activity in the hand area slowed RTs for pictures of hands more than feet; and (iii) left primary motor cortex is involved relatively late in the mental rotation process.

VHydro\u2010climatic and land use changes in the River Lune catchment, North West England, implications for catchment management __ Reported trends across the British Isles, illustrate changing rainfall gradients. Northern areas have become wetter in recent decades with greater variation between NW and SE rainfall totals. This paper explores hydro\u2010climatic changes in North\u2010West England over the last 140 years as part of a whole catchment investigation into the nature and causes of change in fluvial geomorphology. Variability in runoff in the Lune catchment is explained in terms of observed climate and land use changes; implications for river and catchment management are discussed. Area average annual rainfall in the North\u2010West of England show no clear trend over the last 100 years although rain gauges at higher altitudes appear to show increased totals. Over the last 30 years changes in the seasonality of rainfall have been observed. A greater proportion of annual rainfall has occurred in the winter half\u2010year and an increased frequency of wet\u2010days has been linked to catchment\u2010scale flooding. More rain falling on upland areas (>\u2009300\u2009m) has resulted in more rapid runoff from these areas enhanced by land use practices\u2014specifically in heavily grazed hills with a short vegetation cover. The result is a highly varied runoff response within the catchment with localized increases in stream power and the potential for geomorphic change. This effect is \u2018damped\u2019 lower down the catchment highlighting the importance of within catchment variability and the need to conduct hydrological analysis at smaller than whole catchment scales. These findings have important implications for water resources, in particular: water storage within catchments; changes in the duration and frequency of floods and droughts; mobilization of sediment; erosion; channel and flood risk management; and ecological function.

VDNA Damage Induced by 3,3\u2032-Dimethoxybenzidine in Liver and Urinary Bladder Cells of Rats and Humans __ 3,3\u2032-Dimethoxybenzidine (DMB), a congener of benzidine used in the dye industry and previously found to be carcinogenic in rats, was evaluated for its genotoxic activity in primary cultures of rat and human hepatocytes and of cells from human urinary bladder mucosa, as well as in liver and bladder mucosa of intact rats. A similar modest dose-dependent frequency of DNA fragmentation was revealed by the alkaline elution technique in metabolically competent primary cultures of both rat and human hepatocytes exposed for 20 h to subtoxic DMB concentrations ranging from 56 to 180 \u03bcM. Replicating rat hepatocytes displayed a modest increase in the frequency of micronucleated cells after a 48-h exposure to 100 and 180 \u03bcM concentrations. In primary cultures of human urinary bladder mucosa cells exposed for 20 h to 100 and 180 \u03bcM DMB, the Comet assay revealed a clear-cut increase of DNA fragmentation. In rats given one-half LD50 of DMB as a single oral dose, the GSH level was reduced in both the liver and urinary bladder mucosa, whereas DNA fragmentation was detected only in the bladder mucosa. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that DMB should be considered a potentially genotoxic chemical in both rats and humans; the selective effect on the rat urinary bladder might be the consequence of pharmacokinetic behavior.

VDouble Dissociation between Motor and Visual Imagery in the Posterior Parietal Cortex __ Because motor imagery (MI) and visual imagery (VI) are influenced differently by factors such as biomechanical constraints or stimulus size, it is conceivable that they rely on separate processes, possibly involving distinct cortical networks, a view corroborated by neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies. In the posterior parietal cortex, it has been suggested that the superior parietal lobule (SPL) underlies VI, whereas MI relies on the supramarginalis gyrus (SMG). However, because several brain imaging studies have also shown an overlap of activations in SPL and SMG during VI or MI, the question arises as to which extent these 2 subregions really contribute to distinct imagery processes. To address this issue, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce virtual lesions of either SMG or SPL in subjects performing a MI (hand drawing rotation) or a VI (letter rotation) task. Whatever hemisphere was stimulated, SMG lesions selectively altered MI, whereas SPL lesions only affected VI, demonstrating a double dissociation between MI and VI. Because these deficits were not influenced by the angular distance of the stimuli, we suggest that SMG and SPL are involved in the reenactment of the motor and visual representations, respectively, and not in mental rotation processes per se.

VFactors influencing the features of postherpetic neuralgia and outcome when treated with tricyclics __ This paper retrospectively reviews features of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in up to 279 personal patients in relation to treatment outcome when treated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Factors affecting characteristics of PHN: (i) Patients with allodynia (89%) and/or burning pain (56%) have a much higher visual analogue pain intensity score than those without; (ii) Acyclovir (ACV) given for acute shingles (HZ) does not reduce the incidence of subsequent PHN, but reduces the pain intensity in PHN patients with allodynia; (iii) ACV given for acute HZ reduces the incidence of burning pain in subsequent PHN, but not of allodynia; (iv) ACV given for acute HZ reduces the incidence of clinically detectable sensory deficit in subsequent PHN. Factors affecting outcome of TCA\u2010treated PHN: (i) The point in time at which TCA treatment is commenced is by far the most critical factor: started between 3 and 12 months after acute HZ onset, more than two\u2010thirds obtain pain relief (NNT=1.8); between 13 and 24 months, two\u2010fifths (41%) (NNT=3.6); and more than two years, one\u2010third (NNT=8.3). Background and paroxysmal pain disappear earlier and are more susceptible of relief than allodynia. (ii) Twice as many (86%) of PHN patients without allodynia obtain pain relief with TCA treatment than those with (42%); (iii) the use of ACV for acute HZ more than halves the time\u2010to\u2010relief of PHN patients by TCAs; (iv) PHN patients with burning pain are significantly less likely to obtain pain relief with TCAs than those without (p<0.0001).

VThe system CO2-N2 at high pressure and applications to fluid inclusions __ Postulated fluid-fluid immiscibility of 50\u201350% CO2-N2 mixtures has been checked by high-pressure experiments (<5 GPa; <400 K) and could be rejected. The implications for the interpretation of high-density fluid inclusions (<42 cm3/mole) in eclogite and granulite-facies rocks are discussed: only models based on LG-immiscibility are applicable for molar volume calculations also in the very-high-pressure range. The position of the critical curve for CO2-N2 could be more accurately determined with the help of experimental and fluid inclusion data. The S2-F isopleth and the three-phase (S1S2F) line have been established for 50.6% N2 composition.

VExtension of the In-Gel Release Method for Structural Analysis of Neutral and Sialylated N-Linked Glycans to the Analysis of Sulfated Glycans: Application to the Glycans from Bovine Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone __ This paper reports an extension of the in-gel technique for releasing N-linked glycans from glycoproteins for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry reported by B. Küster, S. F. Wheeler, A. P. Hunter, R. A. Dwek, and D. J. Harvey (1997, Anal. Biochem. 250, 82\u2013101) to allow it to be used for sulfated glycans. The method was used to identify N-linked glycans from bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone. Following glycan release, either in gel or in solution, the glycans were fractionated directly with a porous graphatized carbon column. The sulfated glycans were examined by MALDI mass spectrometry in negative ion mode with d-arabinosazone as the matrix and both neutral and acidic glycans were examined in positive ion mode from 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Negative ion post-source decay spectra were also obtained. Twenty-two neutral and fifteen sulfated N-linked glycans were identified and it was shown that negligible loss of sulfate groups occurred even though these groups are often readily lost during MALDI analysis. The glycans were mainly sulfated hybrid and biantennary complex structures. Negative ion post-source decay and positive ion collision-induced fragmentation spectra were obtained.

VUltrasonic acoustic emissions from excised stems of two Thryptomene species __ Stems of Thryptomene vaxicola (A. Cunn.) Shau. cut in air and immediately placed in water at 20°C showed ultrasonic acoustic emissions after 8 to 12 h. whereas no emissions were found in Thryptomene catycina Lindl.) Stapf, within 100 h. Stem water potential declined in a similar manner in both species: a high frequency of acoustic emissions stalrted at approximately \u20131 000 kPa in T.saxicola., but had not commenced at \u20135300 kPa in T. calycina. The rates of water uptake were similar in both species. Acoustic emissions in T.saxicola placed in water were prevented h recutting 15 cm of the stems under water. For comparison, cut stems which were air\u2010dehydrated at 20°C exhibited a primary peak in the frequency of emission after 3\u20135 h in T. saxicola and 15 h in T. catycina, corresponding to a water potential of \u20131000 kPa and less than \u20135000 kPa. respectively. After 6. 16. and 24 h of dehydration in air and subsequent placement in water for 24 h. the rates of water uptake of T. calycina were not lower than in controls not held dry, How ever. in T. saxicola water uptake rates had decreased after 16 h of dehydration and were very low after 24 h. The results show that ultrasonic acoustic emissions may occur in freshly cut stems placed in water, and that they occur at a water potential similar to that in stems allowed to dehydrate in air. The number ol emissions in T.saxicola stems placed in water was apparently too low to inhibit water uptake. When held dry. the cavitated xylem elements may be a cause of reduced water uptake in T. saxicola.

VCerebral processes during visuo\u2010motor imagery of hands __ We investigated the role of cerebral motor structures during mental hand rotation. Neural activity was measured with event\u2010related potentials (ERPs) in 16 healthy participants while they performed handedness judgments of visually presented hands. Mental rotation was associated with ERP amplitude modulations as early as 170 ms but most strongly during a time window of about 600\u2013800 ms. Source analysis of ERPs during these time windows indicated generators in bilateral extrastriate and parietal cortices. The results do not support a direct involvement of anterior motor cortices in the neural computations underlying mental rotation. However, motor regions may play a role in providing ongoing kinaesthetic feedback during mental rotation or in checking the results of the imagined transformation.

VSynthesis of pyrene\u2014acridine bis-intercalators and effects of binding to DNA __ A bis-intercalating compound containing pyrene and 9-aminoacridine chromophores (N-(5-(1-pyrenyl)-pentyl)-6-(9-acridinylamino) hexylamide, I), was prepared and its interaction with double-stranded DNA was investigated. Homologous compounds in which the two chromophores were connected by a linear carbon chain (pentamethylene (II), tetramethylene (III) and methylene (IV)) were also prepared. In acetonitrile solutions of the free ligands, the presence of the proximal pyrene results in reduced acridine fluorescence relative to 9methylaminoacridine (9-MAA), and the degree of quenching increases with decreasing chain length. The quenching process is assigned to exothermic electron transfer from pyrene to the excited 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) chromophore. In the presence of DNA, the relative quenching order is reversed, and I and IV are quenched more strongly than II and III. From linear dichroism experiments, it is concluded that I binds by bis-intercalation of the pyrene and acridine moieties, III and IV undergo intercalation of the acridine chromophore and II binds by partial bis-intercalation at two contiguous sites.

VMATERNAL CELL CONTAMINATION IN UNCULTURED AMNIOTIC FLUID __ The presence of maternal cells in uncultured amniotic fluid may result in error in the interpretation of prenatal tests such as direct DNA analysis and rapid aneuploidy detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using simultaneous dual colour X and Y FISH, we assessed maternal cell contamination in uncultured amniotic fluids from 500 women carrying male fetuses. The presence of maternal cells was correlated with the amount of blood present in the amniotic fluid as defined by visual examination of the cell pellet after centrifugation. The overall rate of maternal cell contamination in uncultured amniotic fluid as identified using X and Y\u2010specific probes was 21·4 per cent, compared with 0·2 per cent in cultured fluid. Sixteen per cent of slightly bloody and 55 per cent of moderately bloody uncultured fluids had at least 20 per cent maternal cells and were classified as uninformative according to our protocol for rapid aneuploidy detection. Maternal and fetal cells could not be distinguished based on morphological characteristics alone.

High-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used to develop a method for the routine measurement of \u03b3-glutamyl conjugates of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in gastropod tissues.

VUse of Serology to Diagnose Pneumonia Caused by Nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis __ Antibodies against nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis were measured by ELISA in paired sera from 158 adult patients with pneumonia. A mixture of 10 clinical isolates of each species was used as antigen. Eleven patients (7%) showed significant increases in antibody to H. influenzae. In 3 of them, the organism was isolated from transtracheal aspirate and in another 7 from sputum, nasopharynx, or both. Six patients with nonencapsulated H. influenzae in transtracheal aspirate cultures did not show any antibody increase. Six patients had significant increases in antibody to M. catarrhalis. The organism was isolated in transtracheal aspirates from 1 of them and in sputum and nasopharynx (or both) from another 3. Two patients with M. catarrhalis in transtracheal aspirate cultures showed no antibody response. In conclusion, the serologic methods increased the possibility to diagnose infections caused by the two agents but had low sensitivity.

VStatistical surface ozone models: an improved methodology to account for non-linear behaviour __ Using UK data as a case study, this paper demonstrates that statistical models of hourly surface ozone concentrations require interactions and non-linear relationships between predictor variables in order to accurately capture the ozone behaviour. Comparisons between linear regression, regression tree and multilayer perceptron neural network models of hourly surface ozone concentrations quantify these effects. Although multilayer perceptron models are shown to more accurately capture the underlying relationship between both the meteorological and temporal predictor variables and hourly ozone concentrations, the regression tree models are seen to be more readily physically interpretable.

VInitial stage of sodium cluster formation in NaCl after intense electron pulse irradiation __ Optical absorption spectra of electron-irradiated NaCl after consecutive heating steps are measured. Thermal annealing of the localized electron centers and growth of the band (peaking at 2.10 eV) due to sodium clusters are examined using computer analysis of the optical absorption spectrum. It has revealed that the sodium clusters may be nucleated from the N1 centers, and that the 2.10 eV band is initially composed of two peaks appearing around 1.70 and 2.30 eV, respectively. The oscillation mode of metal aggregates on the basis of dipole-dipole interaction suggests that these two peaks are attributed to the surface plasma oscillation of planar aggregates being formed at the initial stage.

VNonlinear analysis of imperfect laminated thin plates under transverse and in-plane loads and resting on an elastic foundation by a semi-analytical approach __ The large deflection and postbuckling behavior of imperfect composite laminated plates exposed to a combined action of transverse loads and in-plane edge compressions and resting on an elastic foundation are investigated in this paper by a semi-analytical approach. The formulations are based on the classical laminated plate theory (CLPT), and include the plate\u2013foundation interaction effects via a two-parameter model (Pasternak-type) from which Winkler elastic foundation can be recovered as a limiting case. The present approach employs a perturbation technique, one-dimensional differential quadrature approximation and the Galerkin procedure to model the nonlinear performance of the plate with arbitrary combination of simply supported, clamped or elastic rotational edge constraints. Studies concerning its accuracy and convergence characteristics are carried out through some numerical illustrations. Effects of foundation stiffness, plate aspect ratio, total number of plies, fiber orientation, initial geometrical imperfection, the character of boundary conditions, and load patterns on the nonlinear behavior of the plate are studied. Typical numerical results are given in dimensionless graphical forms.

VThe cost\u2010effectiveness of long\u2010term antiviral therapy in the management of HBeAg\u2010positive and HBeAg\u2010negative chronic hepatitis B in Singapore __ Summary.\u2002 The purpose of this study was the economic evaluation of short\u2010duration treatments of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and longer duration antiviral treatment for up to 5\u2003years. Two 10\u2010health state Markov models were developed for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)\u2010positive and HBeAg\u2010negative CHB patients respectively. The perspective of this economic evaluation was the Singapore healthcare system and CHB patient. The models followed cohorts of HBeAg\u2010positive and HBeAg\u2010negative CHB patients, respectively, over a period of 40\u2003years, by which time the majority of the cohorts would have died if left untreated. Costs and benefits were discounted at 5% per annum. Annual rates of disease progression and the magnitude of treatment effects were obtained from the literature, with a focus on data obtained in Asian patients and meeting the criteria for therapy as described in internationally recognized management guidelines. Short\u2010course therapy with \u03b1\u2010interferon, or 1\u2010year treatment with pegylated interferon \u03b1\u20102a, lamivudine or adefovir had limited impact on disease progression. In contrast, treatment of CHB with antiviral therapy for 5\u2003years substantially decreased the rate of disease progression. Treatment with lamivudine for 1\u2010year is highly cost\u2010effective compared with no treatment of CHB but has limited effect on reducing the rate of disease progression. Compared with 1\u2010year treatment with lamivudine, sequential antiviral therapies for up to 5\u2003years (i.e. lamivudine plus adefovir on emergence of lamivudine resistance or adefovir plus lamivudine on emergence of adefovir resistance) are highly cost\u2010effective by international standards. These conclusions are robust to uncertainties in model inputs and are consistent with the findings of other recently published studies.

VDiffusion of product signs in industrial networks the advantage of the trendsetter __ Purpose Nowadays, the strategic role of design is reinforced by the increased attention that customers pay to the aesthetic, symbolic and emotional values of products. These values can be communicated through the appropriate combination of product signs such as form, colours, materials and so on, which gives meaning to a product. Consequently, companies are investing substantial efforts in appropriate strategies for the development of product signs and languages. Firms must understand how knowledge about new products signs diffuses in industrial networks in order to be able to access and exploit it. The purpose of this paper is to ask, does the capability to propose new product trends allow companies to be recognized as innovators Does the early adoption of product signs positively affect consumer preferences Designmethodologyapproach An empirical analysis is conducted on strategies regarding a specific type of product within the Italian furniture industry namely, chairs. In particular, the paper explores the roles played by furniture companies in the diffusion processes of product signs. Analysing approximately 300 chairs marketed by 35 leading Italian furniture manufacturers between 1996 and 2005, the paper explores different strategies adopted in the diffusion processes of product signs. Findings The empirical results illustrate how trendsetters are able to attain the best performance in terms of innovativeness and, in part, consumer preferences by forwarding new interpretations of existing material combinations starting at the early phases of diffusion. Originalityvalue The paper analyses the different roles played by companies in the diffusion processes of product signs and thus provides interesting insights regarding the exploitation of the industrial resources of companies.

VOptimal Investment with Costly Reversibility __ Investment is characterized by costly reversibility when a firm can purchase capital at a given price and sell capital at a lower price. We solve for the optimal investment of a firm that faces costly reversibility under uncertainty and we extend the Jorgensonian concept of the user cost of capital to this case. We define and calculate cU and cL as the user costs of capital associated with the purchase and sale of capital, respectively. Optimality requires the firm to purchase and sell capital as needed to keep the marginal revenue product of capital in the closed interval [cL, cU). This prescription encompasses the case of irreversible investment as well as the standard neoclassical case of costlessly reversible investment.

VEthanol from lignocellulosics: A review of the economy __ The present study is a review of published investigations regarding the economy of ethanol production from lignocellulosic material. The objective is to present relations between and tendencies observed in different cost estimates. The influence of plant capacity and overall product yield on the ethanol production cost is investigated, as well as variations in capital costs in the different processes. The underlying technical and economic assumptions show a large variation between the various studies published. The variation in the ethanol production cost is large, from 18 to 151 US¢/l. The most important factor for the economic outcome is the overall ethanol yield. Other important parameters are the feedstock cost, which was found to vary between 22 and 61 US$/dry metric ton, and the plant capacity, which influences the capital cost. It is shown that there is a tendency towards a decrease in ethanol production cost with an increase in plant capacity for the enzymatic processes. A high yield also results in a decrease in production cost for the enzymatic and dilute acid processes in the papers reviewed.

VIs the gender difference in mental rotation disappearing? __ Abstract: Several investigators have used meta-analysis to compare the results of studies of gender differences on various spatial tests and have concluded that the magnitude of the gender difference in spatial ability is decreasing over time. The present study used meta-analytic techniques to compare the effect size (d) of the gender difference in 14 studies published from 1975 to 1992 which administered the Mental Rotations test to adolescents and young adults. Males scored significantly higher than females in all the studies. Analyses of thed's computed for the studies revealed that the magnitude of the gender difference on the mental Rotations test has remained stable over time. Neither the Pearson correlation relating thed's to the publication dates of the studies nor the Z test of the linear contrast relating the publication dates of hte studies to the effect sizes showed a linear change in the size of the gender difference over time. The finding of a stable gender difference on the Mental Rotations test argues against the general conclusion that the gender difference in spatial ability is decreasing.

VInvestigation of the stages of the mental rotation of complex figures with the intracortical interaction mapping technique __ Abstract: The stages of the mental rotation of complex three-dimensional figures were investigated in nine healthy subjects using the intracortical interaction mapping technique. It was established that mental rotation is accomplished with the participation of both parietal regions; the prerotation setup is associated with the involvement of the frontal, central, and right temporal divisions of the brain; decision-making regarding the result of the rotation and the response is accomplished through the conjunction of both frontal and temporoparietoocipital regions of the left hemisphere. In the case of the unsuccessful solution of the problem, the process seems to stop at the stage of the prerotation setup. With verbal control the configuration of the zone of high-level association during the first three stages is reminiscent of that observed in the baseline activity.

VTrends in the prescription of antidepressants in urban and rural general practices __ Antidepressant drug (AD) prescriptions written in the period 1983\u20131988 by all GPs working in Verona, Italy were analyzed. The data were provided by a local drug information system and calculated as Defined Daily Dose (DDD). The area was divided in 25 districts, classified on the urban-rural continuum according to population density. Two indices of service provision and two demographic measures were also used in the analysis. An increase in the levels of prescription of AD was observed over the 6 years. No correlation was found between DDD/1000 inhabitants/day rate and population density. This was confirmed using multiple regression analysis, which showed that only the proportion of females in the population was significantly associated with AD prescription. Harmonic analysis of the seasonal variation in prescription showed a moderate degree of seasonality in all districts. When using multiple correlation analysis the seasonality was correlated only with the number of pharmacies available in each district.

VAudio Watermarking Based on Music Content Analysis: Robust against Time Scale Modification __ Abstract: Synchronization attacks like random cropping and time scale modification are crucial to audio watermarking technique. To combat these attacks, a novel content-dependent temporally localized robust audio watermarking method is proposed in this paper. The basic idea is to embed and detect watermark in selected high energy local regions that represent music transition like drum sounds or note onsets. Such regions correspond to music edge and will not be changed much for the purpose of maintaining high auditory quality. In this way, the embedded watermark is expected to escape the damages caused by audio signal processing, random cropping and time scale modification etc, as shown by the experimental results.

VPost\u2010training excitotoxic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus attenuate generalization in auditory delay fear conditioning __ An abundance of evidence indicates a role for the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in learning and memory. Pavlovian fear conditioning provides a useful model system in which to investigate DH function because conditioning to polymodal contextual cues, but generally not to discrete unimodal cues, depends upon the integrity of the DH. There is some suggestion that the hippocampus may be involved in generalization to discrete auditory stimuli following conditioning, but the available literature offers conflicting results regarding the nature of hippocampus involvement. The present experiments were designed to address a role for the DH in auditory generalization following delay fear conditioning. Rats were trained with two or 16 trials of delay fear conditioning and subsequently given a neurotoxic lesion of the DH or sham surgery. Upon recovery, they were tested for fear conditioned responding to the auditory stimulus they were trained with, as well as generalized responding to a novel auditory stimulus. Sham animals showed substantial generalization to the novel stimulus when trained with two or 16 trials. However, lesion animals showed much less generalization (better discriminative performance) to the novel stimulus following 16 conditioning trials while still showing substantial fear conditioned freezing to the trained stimulus. A second experiment showed that this effect was not the result of a non\u2010associative response to the novel stimulus. We conclude that, with extended training, animals become capable of discriminating between trained and novel stimuli but another hippocampus\u2010dependent process maintains generalized responding.

VWhat is complexity? __ Arguments for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity are weakened by the lack of an unambiguous definition of complexity. Such definitions abound for both dynamical systems and biological organisms, but have drawbacks of either a conceptual or a practical nature. Physical complexity, a measure based on automata theory and information theory, is a simple and intuitive measure of the amount of information that an organism stores, in its genome, about the environment in which it evolves. It is argued that physical complexity must increase in molecular evolution of asexual organisms in a single niche if the environment does not change, due to natural selection. It is possible that complexity decreases in co\u2010evolving systems as well as at high mutation rates, in sexual populations, and in time\u2010dependent landscapes. However, it is reasoned that these factors usually help, rather than hinder, the evolution of complexity, and that a theory of physical complexity for co\u2010evolving species will reveal an overall trend towards higher complexity in biological evolution.

VThe mathematics of mental rotations __ A mathematical analysis of the structure of rotations and the dynamics of linear recurrent connectionist networks suggests a simple strategy for implementing mental rotations on a parallel distributed processing (PDP) architecture. Rather than encode a separate map for each combination of rotation axis and degree of rotation, the net embodies generators for infinitesimal rotations about three linearly independent axes. Finite rotations about an arbitrary axis are then generated in real time by the natural dynamics of the net operating under the influence of the appropriate linear combination of the three generators. The resulting transformation proceeds at a constant rate.

VA Brain Data Integration Model Based on Multiple Ontology and Semantic Similarity __ Abstract: In this paper, a brain data integration model(BDIM) is proposed by building up the Brain Science Ontology(BSO), which integrates the existing literature ontologies used in brain informatics research. Considering the features of current brain data sources, which are usually large scale, heterogeneous and distributed, our model offers brain scientists an effective way to share brain data, and helps them optimize the systematic management of those data. Besides, a brain data integration framework(BDIF) is presented in accordance with this model. Finally, many key issues about the brain data integration are also discussed, including semantic similarity computation, new data source insertion and the brain data extraction.

VThe role of mental rotation and age in spatial perspective\u2010taking tasks: when age does not impair perspective\u2010taking performance __ The relationship between self\u2010evaluation of sense of direction, mental rotation, and performance in map learning and pointing tasks has been investigated in a life\u2010span perspective. Study 1 compared younger and older people in the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and on the Sense of Direction and Spatial Representation (SDSR) Scale. Older people achieved higher scores on the SDSR Scale, but a lower performance in MRT compared with younger participants. In Study 2, groups of younger and older adults, one of each, were matched in the MRT, and pointing tasks in aligned and counter\u2010aligned perspectives were administered. Our results showed that, when so matched, older participants performed better than the younger counterparts in perspective\u2010taking tasks, but their performance was worse in map learning. Aligned pointing was performed better than the counter\u2010aligned task in both age groups, showing an alignment effect. Furthermore the performance in the counter\u2010aligned pointing was significantly correlated with MRT scores. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VWhen is a view unusual? A single case study of orientation-dependent visual agnosia __ Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why some neurological patients fail to recognise objects from unusual views: that it results from difficulty identifying an object's principal axis when it is foreshortened, identifying an object when landmark features are occluded, or an inability to rotate mental images. It was possible to test these hypotheses by examining the recognition abilities of a single case (A.S.), by using stimuli that were \u201cunsusual\u201d only because of picture-plane misorientation. A.S. showed a recognition deficit in which his accuracy was proportional to the extent of misorientation from the normal upright for the object\u2014although both principal axis and feature information remain visible after picture-plane rotation. Furthermore, A.S. performed with normal accuracy, and normal pattern of reaction time performance, on tasks of mental rotation. These findings suggest that none of these traditional accounts can adequately explain why this patient was unable to recognise objects from unusual views. These findings are discussed the light of recent suggestions of the basis of this type of disorder.

VA model of blood\u2013brain barrier permeability to water: Accounting for blood inflow and longitudinal relaxation effects __ A noninvasive technique for measuring the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to water could help to evaluate changes in the functional integrity of the BBB that occur in different pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis or growth of brain tumor. Recently, Schwarzbauer et al. (Magn Reson Med 1997;37:769\u2013777) proposed an MR method to measure this permeability based on the T1 reductions induced by injecting various doses of paramagnetic contrast agent. However, this method may be difficult to implement in a clinical environment. Described here is a two\u2010point technique, in which a spatially selective inversion is used to measure T1 prior to and after injection of an intravascular contrast agent. Measurements made in the rat brain are compared to numerical simulations generated with a physiological model that accounts for blood flow and includes two different blood volumes: nonexchanging and exchanging blood volumes. Our results suggest that BBB permeability could be evaluated from the change in T1 caused by the vascular contrast agent. This technique might provide an approach for monitoring changes in BBB permeability to water in clinical studies. Magn Reson Med 47:1100\u20131109, 2002. © 2002 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

This occurred at concentrations beyond that required for optimal response as judged by reduction of blast cell formation and tritiated thymidine and tritiated uridine incorporation into DNA and RNA, respectively. In contrast, bone marrow plasma from these patients was non\u2010inhibitory or contained significantly less inhibitory activity. Bone marrow plasma from the majority of healthy controls was superior to their peripheral blood plasma in enhancing phytohaemagglutinin\u2010induced mitogenesis. The difference between an individual's bone marrow\u2010 and peripheral blood\u2010derived plasma in enhancing proliferation of patient and healthy control cells was significantly greater amongst the patients than the healthy control group; this was attributed mainly to the increased inhibitory activity of ALL peripheral blood plasma compared with normal plasma. Medium conditioned by phytohaemagglutinin\u2010stimulated normal peripheral blood lymphocytes was effective in neutralizing the inhibitory activity of ALL peripheral blood plasma. Taken together, these in vitro results are at least suggestive that in vivo, in healthy subjects, the rapidly proliferating cells in the bone marrow and the \u2018resting\u2019 blood cells in the circulation may be under the influence of a fine balance of different types and/or levels of humoral growth stimulatory and inhibitory factors and that in ALL an unstable balance of these factors exists. The decreased proliferation of circulating blast cells compared with bone marrow blasts in ALL may be attributed, at least in part, to exposure to the different levels of inhibitor(s) in the circulation and bone marrow as demonstrated in vitro by our results.

VMagnetic exchange interaction in clusters of orbitally degenerate ions. II. Application of the irreducible tensor operator technique __ The irreducible tensor operator technique in R3 group is applied to the problem of kinetic exchange between transition metal ions possessing orbitally degenerate ground states in the local octahedral surrounding. Along with the effective exchange Hamiltonian, the related interactions (low-symmetry crystal field terms, Coulomb interaction between unfilled electronic shells, spin\u2013orbit coupling and Zeeman interaction) are also taken into account within a unified computational scheme. Extension of this approach to high-nuclearity systems consisting of transition metal ions in the orbital triplet ground states is also demonstrated. As illustrative examples, the corner-shared D4h dimers 2S+1T2\u20132S+1T2 and 2S+1T1\u20132S+1T1 are considered. Finally, the developed approach is applied to the calculation of the energy levels and magnetic properties of the 2T2\u20132T2 corner-shared dimer. The problem of the magnetic anisotropy arising from the orbital interactions is discussed and the influence of different relevant interactions is revealed.

VDisturbed visuo-spatial orientation in the early stage of Alzheimer's dementia __ A pilot study was conducted to assess previously unrecognized visuo-spatial disturbances in 45 Alzheimer's demented (AD) patients and 59 control persons all over the age of 65 years, living in the community. The results of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) revealed high frequency (78%) of deficient performative visuo-spatial skills of mild and moderate demented AD patients. The severity of dementia was found to be a good predictor of the deficit in visuoconstructive performance. The most frequent drawing mistakes were the misplacement of numbers and clock hands, which may relate to dysfunctions of the right inferior parietal cortex. The right-left orientation (RLO) for the own body was not deteriorated in AD patients. However, significantly lower scores for RLO in the mental rotation subtest were found in mild and moderate AD groups. There were large inter-individual differences in the test scores of both demented groups. Thirty-one percent and 49% of the AD patients scored 0 points or within the normal range (more than 4 points), respectively, indicating a pseudofocal onset pattern of the dementia. The results of the CDT and Right-Left Orientation Test (RLOT) with Mental rotation showed significant positive correlation with other cognitive functions of Mini Mental State Exam, such as attention-calculation, recall and writing, and indicate that the visuo-spatial orientation (VSO) is a composite of different cognitive skills. The CDT and RLOT appears to be a useful tool for screening the elderly for disturbed VSO.

VA Survey of Propulsion Options for Cargo and Piloted Missions to Mars __ Abstract: In this paper, high\u2010power electric propulsion options are surveyed in the context of cargo and piloted missions to Mars. A low\u2010thrust trajectory optimization program (raptor) is utilized to analyze this mission. Candidate thrusters are chosen based upon demonstrated performance in the laboratory. Hall, self\u2010field magnetoplasmadynamic (MPDT), self\u2010field lithium Lorentz force accelerator (LiLFA), arcjet, and applied\u2010field LiLFA systems are considered for this mission. In this first phase of the study, all thrusters are assumed to operate at a single power level (regardless of the efficiency\u2010power curve), and the thruster specific mass and power plant specific mass are taken to be the same for all systems. Under these assumptions, for a 7.5 MW, 60 mT payload, piloted mission, the self\u2010field LiLFA results in the shortest trip time (340 days) with a reasonable propellant mass fraction of 57% (129 mT). For a 150 kW, 9 mT payload, cargo mission, both the applied\u2010field LiLFA and the Hall thruster seem reasonable choices with propellant mass fractions of 42 to 45%(7 to 8 mT). The Hall thrusters provide better trip times (530\u2010570 days) compared to the applied\u2010field LiLFA (710 days) for the relatively less demanding mission.

VTracking and anticipation of invisible spatial transformations by 4- to 8-month-old infants __ The ability of 4- to 8-month-old infants to track and anticipate the final orientation of an object following different invisible spatial transformations was tested. A violation-of-expectation method was used to assess infants' reaction to possible and impossible outcomes of an object's orientation after it translated or rotated behind an occluder. Results of a first experiment show that at all ages infants tend to look significantly longer at an impossible orientation outcome following invisible transformations. These results suggest that from 4 months of age, infants have the ability to detect orientation-specific information about an object undergoing linear or curvilinear invisible spatial transformations. A second experiment controlling for perceptual cues that infants might have used in the first experiment to track the object orientation replicates the results with a new sample of 4- and 6-month-old infants. Finally, a control experiment involving no motion yielded negative results, providing further support that infants as young as 4 months old use motion information to mentally track invisible spatial transformations. The results obtained in the rotation condition of both experiments are tentatively interpreted as providing first evidence of some rudiments of mental rotation in infancy.

VThe Colour of Poverty: A Study of the Poverty of Ethnic and Immigrant Groups in Canada __ Research on immigrants' socio\u2010economic performances in Canada has produced mixed results. One reason for this has been the fact that many studies have used measures that rely on average performance of immigrants, and also treat immigrants as a homogeneous group. Also, some measures of economic performance are unnecessarily complicated. The present article argues that this practice masks the diversity of experiences that exist among immigrants. In particular, it is argued that indices based on average income do not adequately reveal the status of low income immigrants. Using poverty status as an indicator of economic performance, the study xamines and compares different groups of immigrants, in terms of their ethnic origin, period of immigration, age at immigration, and their geo\u2010graphical location in Canada.

VPhotoinduced Damage in Leaf Segments of Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and Lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L.) Treated with 5-Aminolevulinic Acid I. Effect on Structural Components of the Photosynthetic Apparatus __ Two different plant species, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were investigated for the sensitivity of thylakoid membrane structures to photoinduced damage caused by treatment with 5 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the dark. At the end of a 16-h period in darkness lettuce leaves accumulated significantly lower amounts of protochlorophyllide (PChlide) per unit leaf area, however, when calculated on a protein basis, considerably higher amounts of PChlide compared to wheat. Additionally small amounts of Magnesium-protoporphyrin-IX (monomethylester) were found. Lettuce leaf segments were characterized, furtheron, by a higher ALA uptake and a higher endogenous pool of nonmetabolized ALA in comparison to wheat.PChlide and non-metabolized ALA that accumulated in darkness were strongly reduced after 1 h of illumination and disappeared nearly completely after a 5-h period of illumination with 120Wm-2. Light exposure to ALA-pretreated leaves revealed typical symptoms for the involvement of activated oxygen species in photodynamic action, to a greater extent in lettuce than in wheat. Photobleaching of pigments was accompanied by degradation of proteins and peroxidation of thylakoid lipids detected by the increase in the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The fluidity of the thylakoid membranes isolated from treated leaves decreased (as measured with 5-doxylstearic acid as spin label).

VSlow information processing after very severe closed head injury: impaired access to declarative knowledge and intact application and acquisition of procedural knowledge __ As an explanation of the pattern of slow information processing after closed head injury (CHI), hypotheses of impaired access to declarative memory and intact application and acquisition of procedural memory after CHI are presented. These two hypotheses were tested by means of four cognitive reaction-time tasks, a semantic memory task, a memory comparison task, a mental rotation task and a mirror reading task. These tasks were administered on two different days to 12 survivors of a CHI tested more than 5 years after injury and a healthy control group of comparable age and education. In three tasks the difficulty of access to declarative knowledge was varied and it was expected that this would slow the CHI group more than the controls. In two tasks opportunities for procedural learning were provided by repeatedly presenting the same cognitive tasks and in one task, the difficulty of access to procedural memory was varied. It was expected that the CHI group would profit as much from this as would the control group. Both hypotheses were supported.

VA rotating-hinge knee replacement for malignant tumors of the femur and tibia __ We evaluated the 2- to 7-year results of a rotating-hinge knee replacement after excision of malignant tumors of the knee joint. There were 25 distal femoral and 7 proximal tibial replacements. The 5-year prosthetic survival for distal femoral replacements was 88%, compared with 58% for proximal tibial replacements. Seven patients underwent prosthetic exchange: 1 for aseptic loosening, 2 for wound slough and perioperative infection, and 4 for articulating component failure. One patient underwent above-knee amputation owing to skin necrosis. The median functional scores at the latest follow-up were 27 by the International Society of Limb Salvage evaluation system and 80 by the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score system. This implant is a promising choice for joint reconstruction after excision of tumors at the knee joint.

VInhibition of the growth of yeasts in fermented salads __ Salads composed of vegetables and/or meat in an oil-in-water emulsion were prepared by fermentation for 7 h at 42°C or 45°C with strains of Lactobacillus spp. Their stability towards spoilage yeasts was studied using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Saccharomyces augeous and Torulaspora delbruecki, isolaled from salads, as well as Pichia membranaefaciens and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. Salads fermented with good lactic starters usually had pH values of \u2264 4.2 and lactic acid concentrations of 0.28 to 0.43% (w/w). High numbers of spoilage yeasts (and production of large volumes of CO2) were not attained in these salads, provided the initial concentration of spoilage yeasts was sufficiently low ( \u2264 100 CFU/g). Inhibition of spoilage yeasts in lactic fermented salads is probably due to lactic acid, the low storage temperature and the low residual oxygen concentration.

VVernalization, photoperiod and GA3 interact to affect flowering of Japanese radish (Raphanus sativus Chinese Radish Jumbo Scarlet) __ Raphanus sativus L. Chinese Radish Jumbo Scarlet has characteristics that make it an excellent plant model for vernalization studies. This study further characterizes flower induction of R.\u2003sativus Chinese Radish Jumbo Scarlet. Seed were imbibed in distilled water containing 0, 10\u22125M or 10\u22123M GA3 for 24 h and were then exposed to 6\u2003±\u20030.5°C (vernalized) for 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 days. Seedlings were then grown under a short\u2010 (8 h) or long\u2010day photoperiod (8 h with or without a 4\u2010h night interruption; 2200\u20130200 h). Of unvernalized plants grown under long\u2010 and short\u2010day conditions, 45 and 3% flowered, respectively. Saturation of the vernalization response occurred after a 4\u2010 or 8\u2010day vernalization treatment when plants were placed under long\u2010 or short\u2010days, respectively. Basal leaf number and days to anthesis decreased when seeds were cooled for 2 or 4 days and were imbibed with 10\u22123M GA3 compared to distilled water only. These data indicate that R.\u2003sativus Chinese Jumbo Scarlet has principally an obligate vernalization requirement when grown under short\u2010days. GA3 application only facilitated flowering when the length of the vernalization treatment was marginal. Taken together, these data support the use of this plant as a model plant for identifying vernalization responses under short\u2010day conditions.

VA heuristic method to reconstruct the history of sequences subject to recombination __ Summary: Sequences subject to recombination and gene conversion defy phylogenetic analysis by traditional methods since their evolutionary history cannot be adequately summarized by a tree. This study investigates ways to describe their evolutionary history and proposes a method giving a partial reconstruction of this history. Multigene families, viruses, and alleles from within populations experience recombinations/gene conversions, so the questions studied here are relevant for a large body of data and the suggested solutions should be very practical. The method employed was implemented in a program, RecPars, written in C and was used to analyze nine retroviruses.

VDevelopmental trajectories for spatial frames of reference in Williams syndrome __ Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder associated with severe visuocognitive impairment. Individuals with WS also report difficulties with everyday wayfinding. To study the development of body\u2010, environment\u2010, and object\u2010based spatial frames of reference in WS, we tested 45 children and adults with WS on a search task in which the participant and a spatial array are moved with respect to each other. Although individuals with WS showed a marked delay, like young controls they demonstrated independent, additive use of body\u2010 and environment\u2010based frames of reference. Crucially, object\u2010based (intrinsic) representations based on local landmarks within the array were only marginally used even by adults with WS, whereas in typical development these emerge at 5 years. Deficits in landmark use are consistent with wayfinding difficulties in WS, and may also contribute to problems with basic localization, since in typical development landmark\u2010based representations supplement those based on the body and on self\u2010motion. Difficulties with inhibition or mental rotation may be further components in the impaired ability to use the correct reference frame in WS.

VBinding of myotoxin a to cultured muscle cells __ B. Baker, A. T. Tu and J. L. Middlebrook. Binding of myotoxin a to cultured muscle cells. Toxicon31, 271\u2013284, 1993.\u2014The binding of radiolabeled myotoxin a to various cultured cell lines was evaluated. One rat skeletal muscle-derived cell line, L8, bound substantially more myotoxin a than did all other cell lines examined. Several biophysical parameters of myotoxin a-L8 binding were determined. Binding was saturable with a moderate binding affinity. Scatchard analysis and Hill plots indicated a single class of binding sites. The binding was reversible, as demonstrated by chase experiments. Radiolabeled myotoxin a bound to the cell surface at a site inaccessible to the general protease, pronase. Specificity and biological relevance of the binding was suggested by competition with unlabeled toxin and various peptides derived from the toxin. Biologically active peptides, corresponding to the N- and C-terminal sequence of myotoxin a, competed with radiolabeled toxin for L8 binding. It was concluded that the L8 system is a suitable cell model to study myotoxin a mechanism of action.

VPrediction of the elution profiles of high-concentration bands in gas chromatography __ The prediction of band profiles in non-linear gas chromatography requires the use of a mass balance equation for the carrier gas and for the components of the feed. An additional equation is required to account for the non-linearity of the pressure profile and the compressibility of the gas phase. Thus, the sorption effect, which is insignificant in liquid chromatography, becomes of major importance in gas chromatography. Originating from the difference between the partial molar volumes of the retained components in the mobile and the stationary phases, this effect combines with the isotherm effect to control the elution profile of high-concentration bands. The influence of the various parameters which determine the relative intensity of the sorption and the isotherm effects is discussed and illustrated.

VMental rotation of laterally presented random shapes in males and females __ Eighteen right-handed subjects (9 male, 9 female) were to decide if laterally presented random shapes were identical or a mirror image of a centrally presented standard shape. The lateral shapes were rotated over 0 °, 60 °, 120 °, 180 °, 240 °, or 300 °. For unrotated (0 °) mirror image stimuli, females showed a significant right visual-field advantage, whereas males showed no significant hemifield effect. The rate of rotation was equivalent for both sexes. Field of presentation did not affect the rotation rate either. The present results support a growing number of findings that indicate that the interpretation of mental rotation as a typical right-hemispheric spatial-processing task is questionable.

VPredicting response to treatment: Differentiating active\u2010factor and non\u2010specific effects __ An important step in providing treatment is prediction of which treatments will be effective for which patients. Common methods for prediction of efficacy, however, are inconsistent with the assumptions of the standard placebo\u2010control paradigm for establishment of efficacy. This is because in prediction of the observed response, one ignores the distinction between response attributable to non\u2010specific factors and that attributable to active\u2010treatment factors. This paper presents a paradigm for the use of log\u2010linear analysis that allows for the development of predictive methods that take into account this distinction. An example with simulated data demonstrates how, if this distinction is ignored, one can reach misleading conclusions and make non\u2010optimal treatment decisions as a result of an inaccurate cost \u2010 benefit analysis of the treatment.

VShewanella oneidensis MR\u20101 mutants selected for their inability to produce soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) complexes are unable to respire Fe(III) as anaerobic electron acceptor __ Summary Recent voltammetric analyses indicate that Shewanella putrefaciens strain 200 produces soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) complexes during anaerobic respiration of sparingly soluble Fe(III) oxides. Results of the present study expand the range of Shewanella species capable of producing soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) complexes to include Shewanella oneidensis MR\u20101. Soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) was produced by S. oneidensis cultures incubated anaerobically with Fe(III) oxides, or with Fe(III) oxides and the alternate electron acceptor fumarate, but not in the presence of O2, nitrate or trimethylamine\u2010N\u2010oxide. Chemical mutagenesis procedures were combined with a novel MicroElectrode Screening Array (MESA) to identify four (designated Sol) mutants with impaired ability to produce soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) during anaerobic respiration of Fe(III) oxides. Two of the Sol mutants were deficient in anaerobic growth on both soluble Fe(III)\u2010citrate and Fe(III) oxide, yet retained the ability to grow on a suite of seven alternate electron acceptors. The rates of soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) production were proportional to the rates of iron reduction by the S. oneidensis wild\u2010type and Sol mutant strains, and all four Sol mutants retained wild\u2010type siderophore production capability. Results of this study indicate that the production of soluble organic\u2010Fe(III) may be an important intermediate step in the anaerobic respiration of both soluble and sparingly soluble forms of Fe(III) by S. oneidensis.

VMortality Associated with Nosocomial Bacteremia Due to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus __ We prospectively studied all cases of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia that occurred during an extensive outbreak of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in our hospital over a 4-year period (January 1990 through September 1993). We report the results of a comparative analysis of the clinical characteristics and mortality rates among patients with nosocomial bacteremia caused by MRSA (84 cases) or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA; 100 cases). The patients with MRSA bacteremia were older than those with MSSA bacteremia (69 years vs. S4 years, respectively; P < .01) and were more likely than those with MSSAbacteremia to have the following predisposing factors: a prolonged hospitalization (32 days vs. 14 days, respectively; P < .01); prior antimicrobial therapy (61% vs. 34%, respectively; P < .01); urinary catheterization (58% vs. 27%, respectively; P < .01); nasogastric tube placement (31% vs. 13%, respectively; P < .01); and prior surgery (45% vs. 31%, respectively; P = .05). Multivariate analysis with use of the stepwise logistic regression method showed a relationship between mortality and the following variables: methicillin resistance (odds ratio [OR], 3), meningitis (OR, 13), and inadequate treatment (OR, 11).

VUnderstanding Individual Differences in Spatial Ability within Females: A Nature/Nurture Interactionist Framework __ This paper reviews a program of research, conducted in collaboration with several of my colleagues, which examines individual differences in spatial ability from a biological/environmental interaction perspective. Our research strategy has been to identify the females who provide the exceptions to the male advantage in mental rotation ability. We tested a \u201cbent twig\u201d model, identifying a subgroup of females predicted to have a combination of genetic potential (assessed through familial handedness patterns) and prior experiences (assessed through choice of major and number of spatial experiences). The identified subgroup of women significantly outperformed all other groups of women on the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test. Using a selective interference paradigm, we also found spatial strategy differences both within and between gender groups. To demonstrate the importance of mental rotation skills for females, we documented a relation between this type of spatial ability and both math SAT's and math self-confidence.

VThe involvement of primary motor cortex in mental rotation revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation __ We used single\u2010pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left primary hand motor cortex and motor evoked potentials of the contralateral right abductor pollicis brevis to probe motor cortex excitability during a standard mental rotation task. Based on previous findings we tested the following hypotheses. (i) Is the hand motor cortex activated more strongly during mental rotation than during reading aloud or reading silently? The latter tasks have been shown to increase motor cortex excitability substantially in recent studies. (ii) Is the recruitment of the motor cortex for mental rotation specific for the judgement of rotated but not for nonrotated Shepard & Metzler figures? Surprisingly, motor cortex activation was higher during mental rotation than during verbal tasks. Moreover, we found strong motor cortex excitability during the mental rotation task but significantly weaker excitability during judgements of nonrotated figures. Hence, this study shows that the primary hand motor area is generally involved in mental rotation processes. These findings are discussed in the context of current theories of mental rotation, and a likely mechanism for the global excitability increase in the primary motor cortex during mental rotation is proposed.

VBRST anomalies and anomalous U(1) gauge symmetries in string theory __ The heterotic string, when compactified from ten to four-dimensional space-time, has a gauge group that often includes apparently anomalous U(1) gauge symmetries which lead to the generation of masses. The resulting mass shifts violate conformal symmetry and BRST invariance, leading to BRST anomalous correlations. Mass renormalisation is carried out in the BRST framework and BRST invariance for both bosons and fermions is restored. This is shown to be a consistent procedure by explicit calculations, using local properties, up to one loop. Extensions to higher loops are briefly discussed.

VAdaptive human-computer interfaces for man-machine interaction in computer-integrated systems __ Human-centred computer-integrated systems are investigated in view of their man-machine interaction requirements. It is shown that adaptive interfaces satisfy all the demands stemming from the requirement of human-centredness. A brief description is given of what kinds of adaptation can be built into the interfaces allowing human-computer interaction in the related computer-integrated systems. Finally, some basic criteria of how to construct efficient, reliable and user-friendly adaptive interfaces, are investigated. After introducing computer-integrated systems and associated human-computer interaction, a general view of the human-computer interfacing problem is given, followed by sections on interface construction, human-centred interfaces, adaptivity/adaptability/adaptation, taxonomy of adaptive interfaces and interface realizations, construction of adaptive interfaces and some trends in applying such interfaces in human-centred computer-integrated systems, especially computer-integrated manufacturing systems.

VIs gastrectomy mandatory for all residual or recurrent gastric cancer following endoscopic resection? a large\u2010scale Korean multi\u2010center study __ Background and Objectives: To clarify optimal treatment guidelines for residual or local recurrence after endoscopic resection (ER). Methods: Eighty\u2010six patients underwent gastrectomy due to incomplete ER and local recurrence after ER. The pathological findings of ER and gastrectomy specimens were analyzed. Results: The cause of gastrectomy was categorized into five groups; submucosal (sm) invasion without margin involvement, positive margin, margin not evaluable, high risk of lymph node metastasis and local recurrence after ER. According to the pathological findings of gastrectomy specimens, remnant cancer and lymph node metastases were found in 56 (65.1%) and in 5 patients (5.8%), respectively. At 10 gastrectomy specimens which were sm invasion without margin involvement, the scattered residual cancer cells were found around the ulcer scar in 2 (20%) patients. In 11 of 44 margin involvement specimens, no residual cancer or lymph node metastasis was found. In patients with local recurrence, mean duration from ER to surgery was 14.8 months, and 19% of patients were found to have sm or deeper depth of invasion. Conclusion: Gastrectomy with lymph node dissection should be performed in patients with sm invasion with or without margin involvement. However, minimal approach other than gastrectomy could further be applied to selected patients. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:6\u201310. © 2008 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

One hundred sixty-seven participants performed visuospatial short-term memory (STM) and WM span tasks, executive functioning tasks, and a set of paper-and-pencil tests of spatial abilities that load on 3 correlated but distinguishable factors (Spatial Visualization, Spatial Relations, and Perceptual Speed). Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated that, in the visuospatial domain, processing-and-storage WM tasks and storage-oriented STM tasks equally implicate executive functioning and are not clearly distinguishable. These results provide a contrast with existing evidence from the verbal domain and support the proposal that the visuospatial sketchpad may be closely tied to the central executive. Further, structural equation modeling results supported the prediction that, whereas they all implicate some degree of visuospatial storage, the 3 spatial ability factors differ in the degree of executive involvement (highest for Spatial Visualization and lowest for Perceptual Speed). Such results highlight the usefulness of a WM perspective in characterizing the nature of cognitive abilities and, more generally, human intelligence.

VQED radiative corrections to massive fermion production in e+e\u2212 annihilation __ Analytical formulae are obtained for the initial state QED corrections to massive fermion pair production in e+e\u2212\u2192f+f\u2212. Results are presented in a form immediately applicable to the exchange of extra Z bosons. They include a cut on the photon energy and soft photon exponentiation. In addition to applications to top-quark production, numerical importance was found for \u03b3 exchange and \u03c4 and b-quark production at LEP/SLC energies.

VMental Rotation in Human Infants: A Sex Difference __ A sex difference on mental-rotation tasks has been demonstrated repeatedly, but not in children less than 4 years of age. To demonstrate mental rotation in human infants, we habituated 5-month-old infants to an object revolving through a 240° angle. In successive test trials, infants saw the habituation object or its mirror image revolving through a previously unseen 120° angle. Only the male infants appeared to recognize the familiar object from the new perspective, a feat requiring mental rotation. These data provide evidence for a sex difference in mental rotation of an object through three-dimensional space, consistently seen in adult populations.

VMental Rotation and the Right Hemisphere __ Mental rotation may be considered a prototypical example of a higher-order transformational process that is nonsymbolic and analog as opposed to propositional. It is therefore a paradigm case for testing the view that these properties are fundamentally right-hemispheric. Evidence from brain-imaging, unilateral brain lesions, commissurotomy, and visual-hemifield differences in normals is reviewed. Although there is some support for a right-hemispheric bias, at least for the holistic rotation of relatively simple shapes, it is unlikely that this bias approaches the degree of left-hemispheric dominance for language-related skills. An evolutionary scenario is sketched in which the characteristically symbolic mode of the left hemisphere evolved relatively late and achieved the quality of recursive generativity only in the late stages of hominid evolution. This forced an increasingly right-hemispheric bias onto analog processes like mental rotation. Such processes nevertheless remain important and are integral even to those processes we think of as highly symbolic, such as language and mathematics.

VWater adsorption on Ge(100): a computational study __ Cluster calculations simulating water dissociation on Ge(100) are presented. We evaluate the electronic structure of molecular water and dissociation products (OH, O, H) in a LCAO-X\u03b1 scheme. Ge 3d core level shifts were approximated by the ionization potentials (IPs) of nonbonding a2 orbitals. Finally, we discuss the nomenclature of hydroxyl groups ligated to different adsorbents. The germanium-adsorbate atomic distance and not simply the perpendicular position above the first Ge(100) layer was found to be the most important chemisorption parameter. This illustrates the importance of directional bonding and contrasts adsorption on metals. Adsorption at open bridge sites will give significantly less perturbation than adsorption at terminal sites. Major perturbations at the former site require movement of substrate atoms to accommodate the necessary short GeO distances. Our calculations suggest that (i) some water dissociation occurs already at 100 K, (ii) two different hydroxyl species are present at the surface, and (iii) one of the hydroxyl ligands is akin to adsorbed oxygen.

VKeeping It in Three Dimensions: Measuring the Development of Mental Rotation in Children with the Rotated Colour Cube Test (RCCT) __ This study introduces the new Rotated Colour Cube Test (RCCT) as a measure of object identification and mental rotation using single 3D colour cube images in a matching-to-sample procedure. One hundred 7- to 11-year-old children were tested with aligned or rotated cube models, distracters and targets. While different orientations of distracters made the RCCT more difficult, different colours of distracters had the opposite effect and made the RCCT easier because colour facilitated clearer discrimination between target and distracters. Ten-year-olds performed significantly better than 7- to 8-year-olds. The RCCT significantly correlated with children\u2019s performance on the Raven\u2019s Coloured Progressive Matrices Test (RCPM) presumably due to the shared multiple-choice format, but the RCCT was easier, as it did not require sequencing. Children from families with a high socio-economic status performed best on both tests, with boys outperforming girls on the more difficult RCCT test sections.

VCan spatial training improve long-term outcomes for gifted STEM undergraduates? __ This one-year longitudinal study investigated the benefits of spatial training among highly gifted science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates (28 female, 49 male). Compared to a randomized control condition, 12 h of spatial training (1) improved the skills to mentally rotate and visualize cross-sections of 3-D objects shortly after training, (2) narrowed gender differences in spatial skills shortly after training, and (3) improved examination scores in introductory physics (d = .38) but not for other STEM courses. After eight months, however, there were no training differences for spatial skills, STEM course grades, physics self-efficacy, or declared majors. Large gender differences, favoring males, persisted for some spatial skills, physics grades, and physics self-efficacy eight months after training. These results suggest that sustained exposure to spatially enriching activities over several semesters or years may be necessary to address gender gaps in spatial skills among highly gifted STEM undergraduates.

VEffect of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and granulocyte colony stimulating factor on melatonin secretion in rats In vivo and in vitro studies __ The study was performed in order to clarify whether granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) affect melatonin production and release. We have found that both factors (GM-CSF at doses of 10.0 and 100.0 \u03bcg/kg, and G-CSF at doses of 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 \u03bcg/kg) stimulate melatonin secretion in rats in vivo. Positive correlations between tested doses of GM-CSF and G-CSF and plasma melatonin levels were observed (P < 0.01). Moreover, GM-CSF at doses of 2.0 and 20.0 ng/ml activated in vitro the pineal gland to melatonin release (P < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner.

VDepressive Symptoms in African\u2010American Women __ This project examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms in an African\u2010American female college student sample. Concordance rates between two of the most widely used psychometric instruments in clinical settings, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, revised edition (MMPI\u20102; Hathway & McKinley, 1967) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mack, & Erbaugh, 1961), were examined. Results revealed that the MMPI\u20102 was a more conservative scale than the BDI in identifying depressive symptom levels. Both scales, however, identified 12% to 18% of the sample as experiencing severe symptoms. Results were interpreted in light of the stress model of depression. Participants who experienced many symptoms also had high levels of anxiety and passive coping styles. One significant covariate in this sample was mother's education level. Participants whose mothers had college experience had fewer depressive symptoms than their first\u2010generation college\u2010experience peers. Results were interpreted in light of the possible ways mothers inoculate their daughters from stressful environments because of their experiences and possible ways to use this process to assist first\u2010generation college students.

VStructural Effects on the RhII\u2010Catalyzed Rearrangement of Cyclopropenes __ The thermocatalytic rearrangement of 2\u2010alkylcycloprop\u20102\u2010ene\u20101\u2010carboxylates (1) in the presence of RhII perfluorobutyrate is regio\u2010 and stereospecific and leads to the substituted metallocarbenes 3. The latter undergo intramolecular C\uf8ffH bond insertion to form cyclopentylidenes (4).

The cyclopropenedicarboxylates 10, in turn, rearrange exclusively to the more substituted metallocarbenes 26, which cyclize to furans 28, With 6e, and 12, products derived from both modes of ring\u2010opening are observed.

VMental rotation of emotional and neutral stimuli __ The main aim of the study was to create and validate emotional version of mental rotation task (MRT). As all previously conducted experiments utilized neutral material only, such an attempt seemed necessary to confirm the generality of mental rotation effect and its properties. Emotional MRT was constructed using photos of negative facial expressions; a compatible neutral MRT was also created, for detailed comparisons. 2- and 3-dimensional figures (Experiment 1) and hexagrams (Experiment 2 and 3) served as affect-free stimuli. In three experiments, emotional MRT version was proven to be valid, whereas only hexagram-based neutral MRT version yielded the expected results. A number of differences between the two versions emerged, concerning response times, accuracy and difficulty of trials. The neutral/emotional MRT procedure, although needing more research, seems to give stable results, making the study of content-bound imagery possible.

VWeichselian palaeoenvironments at Kobbelgård, Møn, Denmark __ Lithostratigraphical and palynological investigations of a coastal cliff section at Kobbelgård, Møn (Denmark) reveal a sedimentary sequence of Weichselian age. Bedded clayey sediments are overlain by stratified silt, sand and occasional beds of clay and gravel. The clay was deposited in water, and most of the silt and sand is aeolian, forming fairly thick units of loess and sand\u2010loess. The lower part of the sequence forms an anticlinal structure, probably of glacio\u2010tectonic orìgìn. The upper part of the sequence appears to represent a depression filling. In the lower part of this, clayey layers alternating with loess deposits suggest wet conditions periodically. In the upper part, loess and fine sand were deposited, interfingering with slope sediments in a periglacial environment from around 24,000 BP almost until the Weichselian glacial maximum. Pollen investigations at the site point to three periods of vegetation. The lowest pollen sequence contains much Ericales, Empetrum and occasionally also Pinus, and is thought to be of Early Glacial or Lower Pleniglacial age. Overlying pollen\u2010bearing strata with high proportions of herbs, including Artemisia, antedate a TL dating of c. 27,000 BP. An upper pollen sequence, derived from slightly organic layers in the depression fill, points to a palaeovegetation almost exclusively of herbs, with Artemisia as an important component. This vegetation is thought to represent a relatively moist site, and is TL dated to c. 24,000 P.

VDecisions and perceptions of recipients in ultimatum bargaining games __ In simple ultimatum bargaining games a bargainer chooses either to accept or to reject an offer. If he or she accepts the offer, payoffs to both parties are established by the offer; if he or she rejects it each receives nothing. The strategic solution to such games is for the person receiving the offer to accept anything greater than zero while the person making the offer demands virtually all the prize for himself or herself. Research has shown that offers are much closer to equality than the strategic solution suggests, and that strategic offers often are rejected. Three explanations have been offered: (1) The subjects are motivated by internalized fairness norms. (2) The subjects do not understand the situation. (3) The subjects are afraid strategic offers will be rejected. Three experiments reported in the present article offer support for the third explanation.

VVisual field differences for clockwise and counterclockwise mental rotation __ Geometric line drawings were presented to normal subjects in the left visual field (LVF) or right visual field (RVF) at various degrees of rotation from a centrally presented vertical standard. The task of the subject was to indicate with a reaction time (RT) response whether the laterally presented stimulus could be rotated into the vertical standard or if it was a rotated mirror image of the standard. In Study 1, an overall right hemisphere superiority was found for RT and accuracy on match trials. Most interestingly, interactions between Visual Field and Rotation Angle for the match accuracy data and between Visual Field and Direction of Rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) for the match RT slopes were found. These interactions suggested that clockwise rotations were more readily performed in the LVF and counterclockwise rotations in the RVF, consistent with other literature for mental rotation. The purpose of Study 2 was to replicate this finding of visual field differences for rotation direction using a design in which direction and degree of rotation were varied orthogonally. No main effect of Visual Field was found. However, significant interactions between Visual Field and Rotation Angle were found for both RT and accuracy, confirming the presence of visual field differences for rotation direction in a new sample of subjects. These differences were discussed in terms of the possibly greater relevance of medially directed stimuli and a possible hemispheric bias for rotation direction, and in terms of interhemispheric transmission factors.

VStrategies in visuospatial working memory for learning virtual shapes __ This study investigated visuospatial working memory (WM) strategies people use to remember unfamiliar randomly generated shapes in the context of an interactive computer\u2010based visuospatial WM task. In a three\u2010phase experiment with random shapes, participants (n\u2009=\u200994) first interactively determined if two equivalent shapes were rotated or reflected; second, memorized the shape; and third, determined if an imprint in a profile view of the ground was a rotated, reflected imprint of the shape, or an imprint not matching the original shape. Participants self\u2010reported these strategies: Key feature, shape interaction, association/elaboration, holistic/perspective, divide and conquer, mental rotation/reflection and others. Participants reporting key features strategy were significantly more accurate on the computer\u2010based visuospatial WM task. These results highlight the importance of strategy in visuospatial WM.

VPre-irradiation carboplatin and etoposide and accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy in patients with high-grade astrocytomas: a phase II study __ Purpose: To investigate feasibility, activity and toxicity of pre-irradiation chemotherapy (CHT) in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma. Material and Methods: Thirty-five patients with glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and ten patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) entered into this study. Three weeks after surgery patients started their CHT consisting of two cycles of carboplatin (CBDCA) (C) 400 mg/m2, day 1 and etoposide (VP 16) (E) 120 mg/m2, days 1\u20133, given in a 3-week interval. One week after the second cycle of CE, accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (ACC HFX RT) was introduced with tumor dose of 60 Gy in 40 fractions in 20 treatment days in 4 weeks, 1.5 Gy b.i.d. fractionation. Results: Responses to two cycles of CE could be evaluated in 29 (67%) of 43 patients who received it. Fourteen patients were found impossible to determine radiographic response due to an absence of post-operative contrast enhancement because they were all grossly totally resected. There were 7, 24% (95% confidence intervals - CI, 9\u201340%), PR (2 AA and 5 GBM), 19 SD, and 3 PD. After RT, of those 29 patients, there were 3 CR and 11 PR (overall objective response rate was 48% (95% CI, 30\u201367%)), 12 SD, and 3 PD. Median survival time (MST) for all 45 patients is 14 months (95% CI, 11\u201320 months, while median time to progression (MTP) for all patients is 12 months (95% CI, 8\u201316 months). Toxicities of this combined modality approach were mild to moderate, with the incidences of CHT-induced grade 3 leukopenia, being 5% (95% CI, 0\u201311%), and grade 3 thrombocytopenia being 7% (95% CI, 0\u201315%). Of RT-induced toxicity, grade 1 external otitis was observed in 26% (95% CI, 13\u201339%), while nausea, vomiting and somnolence were each observed in 5% (95% CI, 0\u201311%) patients. Conclusion: Pre-irradiation CE and ACC HFX RT was a feasible treatment regimen with mild to moderate toxicity, but failed to improve results over what usually would be obtained with \u2018standard\u2019 approach in this patient population.

VContext-dependent optimal substitution matrices __ Substitution matrices are a key tool in important applications such as identifying sequence homologies, creating sequence alignments and more recently using evolutionary patterns for the prediction of protein structure. We have derived a novel approach to the derivation of these matrices that utilizes not only multiple sequence alignments, but also the associated evolutionary trees. The key to our method is the use of a Bayesian formalism to calculate the probability that a given substitution matrix fits the tree structures and multiple sequence alignment data. Using this procedure, we can determine optimal substitution matrices for various local environments, depending on parameters such as secondary structure and surface accessibility.

VFour year clinical statistics of iridium\u2010192 high dose rate brachytherapy __ Background:\u2002 We evaluated the efficacy and complications of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy using iridium\u2010192 (192Ir) combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in patients with prostate cancer. Methods:\u2002 Ninety\u2010seven patients underwent 192Ir HDR brachytherapy combined with EBRT at our institution between February 1999 and December 2003. Of these, 84 patients were analysed in the present study. 192Ir was delivered three times over a period of 2\u2003days, 6\u2003Gy per time, for a total dose of 18\u2003Gy. Interstitial application was followed by EBRT at a dose of 44\u2003Gy. Progression was defined as three consecutive prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) rises after a nadir according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology criteria. The results were classified into those for all patients and for patients who did not undergo adjuvant hormone therapy. Results:\u2002 The 4\u2010year overall survival of all patients, the nonadjuvant hormone therapy group (NAHT) and the adjuvant hormone therapy group (AHT) was 87.2%, 100%, and 70.1%, respectively. The PSA progression\u2010free survival rate of all patients, NAHT, and AHT was 82.6%, 92.0%, and 66.6%, respectively. Of all patients, the 4\u2010year PSA progression\u2010free survival rates of PSA\u2003<\u200320 and PSA\u2003\u2265\u200320 groups were 100%, and 46.8%, respectively. According to the T stage classification, PSA progression\u2010free survival rates of T1c, T2, T3, and T4 were 100%, 82.8%, 100%, and 12.1%, respectively. Prostate\u2010specific antigen progression\u2010free survival rates of groups with Gleason scores (GS)\u2003<\u20037 and GS\u2003\u2265\u20037 were 92.8% and 60.1%, respectively. Of NAHT, PSA progression\u2010free survival of PSA\u2003<\u200320 was 100% vs 46.8% for PSA\u2003\u2265\u200320, that of T1c was 100% vs 75% for T2, and that of GS\u2003<\u20037 was 100% vs 75% for GS\u2003\u2265\u20037. No significant intraoperative or postoperative complications requiring urgent treatment occurred except cerebellum infarction. Conclusions:\u2002 192Ir HDR brachytherapy combined with EBRT was as effective as radical prostatectomy and had few associated complications.

VGene expression profile activated by the chemokine CCL5/RANTES in human neuronal cells __ Differentiated human NT2\u2010N neurons were shown to express CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokine receptor mRNA and protein, and to be responsive to the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL12. Using cDNA microarray technology, CCL5 was found to induce a distinct transcriptional program, with reproducible induction of 46 and 9 genes after 2 and 8 hr of treatment, respectively. Conversely, downregulation of 20 and 7 genes was observed after 2 and 8 hr of treatment, respectively. Modulation of a selected panel of CCL5\u2010responsive genes was also confirmed by quantitative RT\u2010PCR and Western blot and compared to gene expression changes induced by CXCL12 treatment. Gene clustering identified distinct functional subsets of CCL5\u2010responsive molecules, and a significant number of expressed sequence tags encoding unknown genes. CCL5\u2010responsive genes comprise a significant number of enzymes, transcription factors, and miscellaneous molecules involved in neuronal survival and differentiation, including neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Our results suggest that CCL5 biological functions might go beyond its recognized chemotactic activity in the central nervous system, in particular with regard to the control of neural plasticity events both during development and in postnatal life. © 2004 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VStimulus features and sex differences in mental rotation test performance __ This study examined sex differences in spatial abilities using a standard two-dimensional paper-and-pencil test of mental rotation administered to 410 subjects. A personality questionnaire and six other ability tests related to mental rotation were also administered: numerical ability, verbal ability, inductive reasoning, associative memory, perceptual speed and accuracy, and speed of closure. Structural and superficial features of the tasks were specified, and sex differences in accuracy and speed were examined. Certain features of the mental rotation test stimuli (e.g., long trajectories, multilined or multispotted) proved difficult for both males and females, but more difficult for females. These findings were interpreted in the light of Just and Carpenter's (1985) model. Males also completed more items than females. In this regard, personality factors related to cautiousness yielded significant negative correlations with speed. On the related ability tests, males outperformed females on a numerical skills test, and females outperformed males on an associative memory test. No significant sex differences emerged on the other four ability tests.

VAchieving visual object constancy across plane rotation and depth rotation __ Visual object constancy is the ability to recognise an object from its image despite variation in the image when the object is viewed from different angles. I describe research which probes the human visual system\u2019s ability to achieve object constancy across plane rotation and depth rotation. I focus on the ecologically important case of recognising familiar objects, although the recognition of novel objects is also discussed. Cognitive neuropsychological studies of patients with specific deficits in achieving object constancy are reviewed, in addition to studies which test neurally intact subjects. In certain cases, the recognition of invariant features allows objects to be recognised irrespective of the view depicted, particularly if small, distinctive sets of objects are presented repeatedly. In contrast, in most situations, recognition is sensitive to both the view in-plane and in-depth from which an object is depicted. This result suggests that multiple,view-specific, stored representations of familiar objects are accessed in everyday, entry-level visual recognition, or that transformations such as mental rotation or interpolation are used to transform between retinal images of objects and view-specific, stored representations.

VInterferon\u2010gamma independent oxidation of melatonin by macrophages __ Abstract: Mononuclear phagocytes appear to synthesize kynurenine\u2010like products from the oxidation of biologically active indole compounds including melatonin, catalyzed by interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3\u2010inducible enzyme indoleamine 2,3\u2010dioxygenase (IDO). Concanavalin A (Con A) is a plant lectin that induces interferon\u2010gamma (IFN\u2010\u03b3) production by T cells. In this study we investigated whether Con A\u2010primed peritoneal macrophages are able to oxidize melatonin to N1\u2010acetyl\u2010N2\u2010formyl\u20105\u2010methoxykynuramine (AFMK). The AFMK production was accompanied by chemiluminescence. It was found that Con A\u2010primed but not resident macrophages produce AFMK. Surprisingly, Con A\u2010primed macrophages from IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010deficient mice were as effective as macrophages from IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010sufficient mice in oxidizing melatonin. Moreover, addition of an inhibitor of IDO (1\u2010methyltryptophan) did not affect melatonin oxidation. Con A\u2010primed but not resident macrophages have a significant content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibition of MPO by azide completely blocked chemiluminescence and AFMK production. Thus, our findings provide evidence that melatonin oxidation by macrophages may occur through a mechanism dependent of MPO and independent of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IDO activity.

VDifferences in mental rotation strategies for native speakers of Chinese and English and how they vary as a function of sex and college major __ In this study we examine how native language, sex, and college major interact to influence accuracy and preferred strategy when performing mental rotation (MR). Native monolingual Chinese and English speakers rotated 3-D shapes while maintaining a concurrent verbal or spatial memory load. For English speakers, male physical science majors were more accurate than social science majors and employed a spatial/holistic strategy; male social science majors used a verbal/analytic strategy. Regardless of college major, English-speaking females were not consistent in MR strategy. A small overall advantage in accuracy was found for Chinese speakers, and both male and female Chinese-speaking physical science majors relied on a combined spatial/holistic and verbal/analytic strategy; Chinese-speaking social science majors did not show a strategy preference. Our results suggest that acquiring a logographic language like Chinese may heighten spatial ability and bias one toward a spatial/holistic MR strategy.

VTurning the tables: language and spatial reasoning __ This paper investigates possible influences of the lexical resources of individual languages on the spatial organization and reasoning styles of their users. That there are such powerful and pervasive influences of language on thought is the thesis of the Whorf\u2013Sapir linguistic relativity hypothesis which, after a lengthy period in intellectual limbo, has recently returned to prominence in the anthropological, linguistic, and psycholinguistic literatures. Our point of departure is an influential group of cross-linguistic studies that appear to show that spatial reasoning is strongly affected by the spatial lexicon in everyday use in a community (e.g. Brown, P., & Levinson, S. C. (1993). Linguistic and nonlinguistic coding of spatial arrays: explorations in Mayan cognition (Working Paper No. 24). Nijmegen: Cognitive Anthropology Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics; Cognitive Linguistics 6 (1995) 33). Specifically, certain groups customarily use an externally referenced spatial-coordinate system to refer to nearby directions and positions (\u201cto the north\u201d) whereas English speakers usually employ a viewer-perspective system (\u201cto the left\u201d). Prior findings and interpretations have been to the effect that users of these two types of spatial system solve rotation problems in different ways, reasoning strategies imposed by habitual use of the language-particular lexicons themselves. The present studies reproduce these different problem-solving strategies in speakers of a single language (English) by manipulating landmark cues, suggesting that language itself may not be the key causal factor in choice of spatial perspective. Prior evidence on rotation problem solution from infants (e.g. Acredolo, L.P. (1979). Laboratory versus home: the effect of environment on the 9-month-old infant\u2019s choice of spatial reference system. Developmental Psychology, 15 (6), 666\u2013667) and from laboratory animals (e.g. Restle, F. (1975). Discrimination of cues in mazes: a resolution of the place-vs.-response question. Psychological Review, 64, 217\u2013228) suggests a unified interpretation of the findings: creatures approach spatial problems differently depending on the availability and suitability of local landmark cues. The results are discussed in terms of the current debate on the relation of language to thought, with particular emphasis on the question of why different cultural communities favor different perspectives in talking about space.

VThe Mental Representation in Mental Rotation. Its Content, Timing and Neuronal Source __ What is rotated in mental rotation? The implicitly or explicitly most widely accepted assumption is that the rotated representation is a visual mental image. We here provide converging evidence that instead mental rotation is a process specialized on a certain type of spatial information. As a basis, we here develop a general theory on how to manipulate and empirically examine representational content. One technique to examine the content of the representation in mental rotation is to measure the influence of stimulus characteristics on rotational speed. Experiment 1a and 1b show that the rotational speed of university students (10 men, 10 women and 10 men, 11 women, respectively) is influenced exclusively by the amount of represented orientation-dependent spatial-relational information but not by orientation-independent spatial-relational information, visual complexity, or the number of stimulus parts. Obviously, only explicit orientation-dependent spatial-relational information in an abstract, nonvisual form is rotated. As information in mental-rotation tasks is initially presented visually, a nonvisual representation during rotation implies that at some point during processing information is recoded. Experiment 2 provides more direct evidence for this recoding. While university students (12 men, 12 women) performed our mental-rotation task, we recorded their EEG in order to extract slow potentials, which are sensitive to working-memory load. During initial stimulus processing, slow potentials were sensitive to the amount of orientation-independent information or to the visual complexity of the stimuli. During rotation, in contrast, slow potentials were sensitive to the amount of orientation-dependent information only. This change in slow potential behavior constitutes evidence for the hypothesized recoding of the content of the mental representation from a visual into a nonvisual form. We further assumed that, in order to be accessible for the process of mental rotation, orientation-dependent information must be represented in those brain areas that are also responsible for mental rotation proper. Indeed, in an fMRI study on university students (12 men, 12 women) the very same set of brain areas was specifically activated by both the amount of mental rotation and of orientation-dependent information. The amount of orientation-independent information/visual complexity, in contrast, influenced activation in a different set of brain areas. Together, all activated areas constitute the so-called mental rotation network. In sum, the present work provides a general theory and several techniques to examine mental representations and employs these techniques to identify the content, timing, and neuronal source of the mental representation in mental rotation.

VMental Rotation and its Relationship with Motoric Accessibility: An ERP study assessing the effects of a physical barrier on spatial discrimination. __ Considered the hallmark for research on mental rotation, Shepard and Metzler\u2019s  (1971) experiment constructed the foundation for the investigation into cognitive processes guiding rotational movement of objects in a space.  Their data showed that behavioral reaction time increases as a monotonic function of angular disparity, indicating that participants, upon viewing a spatially­altered object, mentally rotate a comparison figure in order to discriminate for the purposes of matching.  Later research conducted on rotation of human body parts (i.e. hands) indicates that this particular motor rotation requires the influence of egocentric proprioceptive (i.e fine muscle movement) information (Parsons, 1995) Based on a study conducted by Thayer and Johnson (2006) to investigate the cerebral structures involved in mental rotation, the current study utilized ERP technology to measure the cortical activation between a hand barrier and a hand non­barrier group.  Thirty undergraduate participants were randomly assigned equally to the two above­mentioned groups and given a right versus left hand discrimination task.  Behavioral results indicate an increase in reaction time with angular departure from conical orientation, while the ERP data reveal significant late negative complex (LNC) and N1 activation increases for the occipital and parietal cortices in the barrier compared to the non­barrier group.  This finding suggests that physical barriers inhibiting motoric cueing can significantly modulate cortical activity associated with the performance of a biomechanical ­ possible anatomical movement ­ rotation task.

VEye movements during mental rotation of nonmirrored and mirrored threedimensional abstract objects __ Eye movements were recorded while participants (N = 56) rotated mirrored and nonmirrored abstract, three-dimensional object pairs into different orientations to assess whether there were oculomotoric differences in fixation switches between mirrored and nonmirrored objects and how an object's plane and depth angle affected visual processing. Compared to other studies, especially depth rotation tasks were responsible for a difference in the sum of fixation switches. This difference seemed to be caused by an increase in incongruent fixation switches, while congruent ones remained stable. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

VEarly Sex Differences in Spatial Skill. __ This study investigated sex differences in young children's spatial skill. The authors developed a spatial transformation task, which showed a substantial male advantage by age 4 years 6 months. The size of this advantage was no more robust for rotation items than for translation items. This finding contrasts with studies of older children and adults, which report that sex differences are largest on mental rotation tasks. Comparable performance of boys and girls on a vocabulary task indicated that the male advantage on the spatial task was not attributable to an overall intellectual advantage of boys in the sample.

VEmergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis __ Sex differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, spatial ability are widely acknowledged, yet considerable dispute surrounds the magnitude, nature, and age of first occurrence of these differences. This article focuses on 3 questions about sex differences in spatial ability: (a) What is the magnitude of sex differences in spatial ability? (b) On which aspects of spatial ability are sex differences found? and (c) When, in the life span, are sex differences in spatial ability first detected? Implications for clarifying the linkage between sex differences in spatial ability and other differences between males and females are discussed. We use meta-analysis, a method for synthesizing empirical studies, to investigate these questions. Results of the meta-analysis suggest (a) that sex differences arise on some types of spatial ability but not others, (b) that large sex differences are found only on measures of mental rotation, (c) that smaller sex differences are found on measures of spatial perception, and (d) that, when sex differences are found, they can be detected across the life span.

VThe influence of juggling on mental rotation performance in children __ This study investigated the influence of juggling training on mental rotation performance. Two groups of 23 participants each solved a chronometrical mental rotation task with three-dimensional block figures. After this, participants of the training group learned to juggle over a period of three months, whereas participants of the non-training group did not. At the end of the three-month period all participants solved the mental rotation task again. The difference between the reaction time (RT) in the first and second mental rotation test was measured. Results showed that the RT gain was higher for the participants of the training group compared to the non-training group when mental rotation had to be performed (i.e., when angular disparity was non-zero). This study provides evidence for the direct relation between motor training and spatial ability.

VVisual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation __ In mental rotation, a mental representation of an object must be rotated while the actual object remains visible. Where is this representation stored while it is being rotated? To answer this question, observers were asked to perform a mental rotation task during the delay interval of a visual working memory task. When the working memory task required the storage of object features, substantial bidirectional interference was observed between the memory and rotation tasks, and the interference increased with the degree of rotation. However, rotation-dependent interference was not observed when a spatial working memory task was used instead of an object working memory task. Thus, the object working memory subsystem--not the spatial working memory subsystem--provides the buffer in which object representations are stored while they undergo mental rotation. More broadly, the nature of the information being stored--not the nature of the operations performed on this information--may determine which subsystem stores the information

VImprovement and assessment of spatial ability in engineering education __ The development of three-dimensional Computer Aided Design (3D CAD) technology has additionally spurred research into spatial ability to find the ways for its enhancement through teaching and instruction and to understand the mechanism of its assessment. The techniques involved in multimedia engineering environment of today as well as their inclusion into engineering curricula and courses have to be strongly supported by wider knowledge of spatial ability.  This paper is a review of research results applied to engineering graphics education by respecting spatial ability as a recognized predictor of success in engineering. The development of engineering graphics teaching based on research suggestions about spatial ability represents an increasingly complex approach that puts additional stress on engineering graphics educators. Thus classical tests for the assessment of spatial ability are described, the applied strategies for their solving are presented, the selected obtained results are compared, and a distinction is drawn between the strategies employed for more complex spatial tasks that engineering is dealing with.

VThe gender difference on the Mental Rotations test is not due to performance factors __ Men score higher than women on the Mental Rotations test (MRT), and the magnitude of this gender difference is the largest of that on any spatial test. Goldstein, Haldane, and Mitchell (1990) reported finding that the gender difference on the MRT disappears when ''performance factors'' are controlled-specifically, when subjects are allowed sufficient time to attempt all items on the test or when a scoring procedure that controls for the number of items attempted is used. The present experiment also explored whether eliminating these performance factors results in a disappearance of the gender difference on the test. Male and female college students were allowed a short time period or unlimited time on the MRT. The tests were scored according to three different procedures. The results showed no evidence that the gender difference on the MRTwas affected by the scoring method or the time limit. Regardless of the scoring procedure, men scored higher than women, and the magnitude of the gender difference persisted undiminished when subjects completed all items on the test. Thus there was no evidence that performance factors produced the gender difference on the MRT. These results are consistent with the results of other investigators who have attempted to replicate Goldstein et al.'s findings.

VPhysical Activity Improves Mental Rotation Performance __ Even there seemed to be general knowledge that physical activity enhanced spatial cognitive performance almost none experimental studies on this influence exist. For that the influence of physical activity on mental rotation performance is investigated in this study. Mental rotation is the ability to imagine how an object would look if rotated away from the original orientation. Two groups of 44 students of educational science each solved a psychometrical mental rotation task with three-dimensional block figures. After this, the participants of the physical activity group took part in a sport lesson, whereas the participants of the cognitive activity group attended an oral lesson of kinematics. Both lessons took 45 minutes. Thereafter, all participants solved the mental rotation task again. The results showed that the participants of the physical activity group improved their mental rotation performance whereas the participants of the cognitive activity showed no improvement.

VGender Differences in Mental Rotation Across Adulthood __ Although gender differences in mental rotation in younger adults are prominent in paper-pencil tests as well as in chronometric tests with polygons as stimuli, less is known about this topic in the older age ranges. Therefore, performance was assessed with the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) paper-pencil test as well as with a computer-based two-stimulus same-different task with polygons in a sample of 150 adults divided into three age groups, 20\u201330, 40\u201350, and 60\u201370 years. Performance decreased with age, and men outperformed women in all age groups. The gender effect decreased with age in the MRT, possibly due to a floor effect. Gender differences remained constant across age, however, in the error rates of the computer-based task.

VThe Improvement of Mental Rotation Performance in Second Graders after Creative Dance Training __ The study presented here investigated the influence of creative dance training on mental rotation performance. Two groups of second graders solved a paper-pencil mental rotation test and a motor performance test. Afterwards one group received five weeks of normal physical education lessons, while the other group received five weeks of creative dance training. At the end of the training period all children solved the mental rotation again. The results show that the dance-training group improved their mental rotation performance more than the physical education group. Further studies should investigate whether this positive effect of creative dance training transfers to cognitive, social, and emotional skills, such as a possible enhancement of self-esteem.

VMental Rotation Performance in Male Soccer Players __ It is the main goal of this study to investigate the visual-spatial cognition in male soccer players. Forty males (20 soccer players and 20 non-athletes) solved a chronometric mental rotation task with both cubed and embodied figures (human figures, body postures). The results confirm previous results that all participants had a lower mental rotation speed for cube figures compared to embodied figures and a higher error rate for cube figures, but only at angular disparities greater than 90°. It is a new finding that soccer\u2013players showed a faster reaction time for embodied stimuli. Because rotation speed did not differ between soccer-players and non-athletes this finding cannot be attributed to the mental rotation process itself but instead to differences in one of the following processes which are involved in a mental rotation task: the encoding process, the maintanence of readiness, or the motor process. The results are discussed against the background of the influence on longterm physical activity on mental rotation and the context of embodied cognition.

VBreaking Out of a Distinct Social Space: Reflections on Supporting Community Participation for People with Severe and Profound Intellectual Disability __ Background\u2002 Typically people with intellectual disability have small, highly restricted social networks characterized by interactions with other people with intellectual disabilities, family members, and paid workers. The goal of \u2018inclusion\u2019 has been central to policies that have shaped services over the past 30\u2003years. It is an ill defined concept with disagreement about its meaning, the problems it seeks to overcome and how it should be realized. Method\u2002 Ethnographic and action research methods were used to support and collect data on the implementation of a programme, known as the Community Inclusion Framework, in a group home for five adults with severe intellectual disabilities in Victoria, Australia. Results and Conclusions\u2002 A pattern of service delivery based on community presence rather than participation evolved and endured over 16\u2003months. The findings show that most staff attached a different meaning to inclusion from that proposed in the Community Inclusion Framework, disagreed with the proposed meaning or felt these residents were too different for it to be meaningful. This suggests that priority will only be accorded to activities that lead to inclusion if staff are convinced of the veracity of this and given strong and consistent direction and support.

VYoung Children's Awareness of Their Mental Activity: The Case of Mental Rotation __ From Piaget's early work to current theory of mind research, young children have been characterized as having little or no awareness of their mental activity. This conclusion was reexamined by assessing children's conscious access to visual imagery. Four\u2010year\u2010olds, 6\u2010year\u2010olds, and adults were given a mental rotation task in the form of a computer game, but with no instructions to use mental rotation and no other references to mental activity. During the task, participants were asked to explain how they made their judgments. Reaction time patterns and verbal reports revealed that 6\u2010year\u2010olds were comparable to adults both in their spontaneous use and subjective awareness of mental rotation. Four\u2010year\u2010olds who referred to mental activity to explain their performance had reaction time and error patterns consistent with mental rotation; 4\u2010year\u2010olds who did not refer to mental activity responded randomly. A second study with 5\u2010year\u2010olds produced similar results. This research demonstrates that conscious access to at least 1 type of thinking is present earlier than previously recognized. It also helps to clarify the conditions under which young children will and will not notice and report their mental activity. These findings have implications for competing accounts of children's developing understanding of the mind and for the \u201cimagery debate.\u201d

VIndistinguishability for a class of nonlinear compartmental models __ Indistinguishability, as applied to nonlinear compartmental models, is analyzed by means of the local state isomorphism theorem. The method of analysis involves the determination of all local, diffeomorphic transformations connecting the state variables of two models. This is then applied to two two-compartmental models, in the first instance with linear eliminations, and then with the addition of eliminations with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In the nonlinear example, the state transformation turns out to be linear or possibly affine. It is found that the nonlinear analysis could be eased by splitting the state isomorphism equations into those of the initial linear models together with extra equations due to the nonlinearities.

VDynamic collapse analysis for a reinforced concrete frame sustaining shear and axial failures __ Shaking table test results from a one\u2010story, two\u2010bay reinforced concrete frame sustaining shear and axial failures are compared with nonlinear dynamic analyses using models developed for the collapse assessment of older reinforced concrete buildings. The models provided reasonable estimates of the overall frame response and lateral strength degradation; however, the measured drifts were underestimated by the models. Selected model parameters were varied to investigate the sensitivity of the calculated response to changes in the drift at shear failure, rate of shear strength degradation, and drift at axial failure. For the selected ground motion, the drift at shear failure and rate of shear strength degradation did not have a significant impact on the calculated peak drift. By incorporating shear and axial\u2010load failure models, the analytical model is shown to be capable of predicting the axial\u2010load failure for a hypothetical frame with three nonductile columns. Improvements are needed in drift demand estimates from nonlinear dynamic analysis if such analyses are to be used in displacement\u2010based performance assessments.

V\u2018Mental rotation\u2019, pictured rotation, and tandem rotation in depth __ The mental rotation effect in depth is qualitatively different from mental rotation in the picture plane. The magnitude of angular difference in depth that is depicted between two static shapes has been thought to predict mean response time for same-different comparisons on shapes in the mental rotation effect. The tandem rotation effect provides a counterexample to that hypothesis. Two planar shapes are depicted as separated by a small and fixed angular difference in depth; the pair of shapes is then depicted as tilted in depth. Mean response time to compare these shapes varies nearly linearly with the magnitude of the yoked rotation - though angular difference is held constant. The slope of this response time function is very close to that for single rotation in depth. The tandem effect supports a claim that mean response time varies as a function of the change in area of planar shapes that are depicted to rotate away from the picture plane, rather than as a function of the angular difference of one shape from another. The tandem rotation effect is not found to obtain for rotations in the picture plane. A conclusion drawn from these and other results is that an hypothesis of mental rotation is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain changes in response times for the simultaneous comparison of planar shapes pictured in depth. A piecewise continuous trigonometric function is proposed to describe response times for the comparison of planar shapes that are depicted to rotate in depth. The characteristic Shepard-Metzler response time function for complex solids in depth is shown to be a definite integral of that trigonometric function.

VAnalysis of the psychrotolerant property of hormone-sensitive lipase through site-directed mutagenesis __ Mammalian hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) has given its name to a family of primarily prokaryotic proteins which are structurally related to type B carboxylesterases. In many of these \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolases, a conserved HG-dipeptide flanks the catalytic pocket. In HSL this dipeptide is followed by two additional glycine residues. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have investigated the importance of this motif for enzyme activity. Since the presence of multiple glycine residues in a critical region could contribute to cold adaptation by providing local flexibility, we studied the effect of mutating these residues on the psychrotolerant property of HSL. Any double mutation rendered the enzyme completely inactive, without any major effect on the enzyme stability. The partially active single mutants retained the same proportion of activity at reduced temperatures as the wild-type enzyme. These results do not support a role for the HGGG motif in catalysis at low temperatures, but provide further validation of the current three-dimensional model of HSL. Rat HSL was found to be relatively more active than human HSL at low temperatures. This difference was, however, not due to the 12 amino acids which are present in the regulatory module of the rat enzyme but absent in human HSL.

VAssessment of a three-dimensional line-of-response probability density function system matrix for PET __ To achieve optimal PET image reconstruction through better system modeling, we developed a system matrix that is based on the probability density function for each line of response (LOR-PDF). The LOR-PDFs are grouped by LOR-to-detector incident angles to form a highly compact system matrix. The system matrix was implemented in the MOLAR list mode reconstruction algorithm for a small animal PET scanner. The impact of LOR-PDF on reconstructed image quality was assessed qualitatively as well as quantitatively in terms of contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) and coefficient of variance (COV), and its performance was compared with a fixed Gaussian (iso-Gaussian) line spread function. The LOR-PDFs of three coincidence signal emitting sources, (1) ideal positron emitter that emits perfect back-to-back rays () in air (2) fluorine-18 (18F) nuclide in water and (3) oxygen-15 (15O) nuclide in water, were derived, and assessed with simulated and experimental phantom data. The derived LOR-PDFs showed anisotropic and asymmetric characteristics dependent on LOR-detector angle, coincidence emitting source, and the medium, consistent with common PET physical principles. The comparison of the iso-Gaussian function and LOR-PDF showed that (1) without positron range and acollinearity effects, the LOR-PDF achieved better or similar trade-offs of contrast recovery and noise for objects of 4mm radius or larger, and this advantage extended to smaller objects (e.g. 2mm radius sphere, 0.6mm radius hot-rods) at higher iteration numbers and (2) with positron range and acollinearity effects, the iso-Gaussian achieved similar or better resolution recovery depending on the significance of positron range effect. We conclude that the 3D LOR-PDF approach is an effective method to generate an accurate and compact system matrix. However, when used directly in expectationmaximization based list-mode iterative reconstruction algorithms such as MOLAR, its superiority is not clear. For this application, using an iso-Gaussian function in MOLAR is a simple but effective technique for PET reconstruction.

VStability of septohippocampal neurons following excitotoxic lesions of the rat hippocampus __ The present study examined the effects of removing hippocampal nerve growth factor (NGF)-producing neurons upon cholinergic and noncholinergic septohippocampal projecting neurons. To deplete septal/diagonal band neurons of their intrinsic source of NGF, rats received unilateral intrahippocampal injections of ibotenic acid and were sacrificed 2\u201324 weeks later. Choline acetyltransferase and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry failed to reveal changes in the number of cholinergic or \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-containing neurons, respectively, within the septal/diagonal band region ipsilateral to the hippocampal lesion at any time point examined. Additionally, immunocytochemical localization of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated neurofilament proteins did not reveal abnormal staining characteristics within the septal/diagonal band complex, suggesting that this lesion does not alter cytoskeletal features of neurons which project to the hippocampus. Selected rats received unilateral hippocampal lesions and 3 months later were injected with fluorogold into the remaining hippocampal remnant and with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horse radish peroxidase into the intact contralateral hippocampus. Both retrograde tracers were predominantly transported to their respective ipsilateral septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band. This indicates that following the lesion, septal/diagonal band neurons still project ipsilaterally and sprouting to the NGF-rich contralateral side does not occur. RNA blot analysis revealed a decrease in NGF mRNA expression within the lesioned hippocampus with a maximum reduction of approximately 70%. In contrast, no change in NGF mRNA expression was observed within the ipsilateral septum relative to the contralateral side. The present study demonstrates that removal of hippocampal target neurons does not alter the number, morphology, or projections of both cholinergic and noncholinergic septal/diagonal band neurons.

VRaman Studies of Molecular Thin Films __ In situ Raman spectroscopy was applied to study thin films of molecules, i.e. C60 and 3,4,9,10\u2010perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) fabricated by Organic Molecular Beam Deposition (OMBD) under ultra\u2010high vacuum conditions. C60 was evaporated onto Si(100) surfaces at room temperature and the deposition process was monitored in situ by Raman spectroscopy in the spectral region 1350\u20131600 cm\u20141, where the most intense Raman features of C60 are observed. Changes observed in the initial stage of deposition indicate that laser induced photopolymerisation of C60 is inhibited until approximately 15 nm film thickness. PTCDA films were also grown by OMBD on Si(100) substrates at different growth temperatures in the range between 230 and 470 K. The Raman spectra exhibit four features assigned to external vibrational modes, that occur as a consequence of the arrangement of the PTCDA molecules in a crystalline environment. The full width at half maximum of these phonon lines decreases with increasing substrate temperature. A similar tendency is also observed for the Raman\u2010active internal molecular modes. The observed spectral changes are related to an increase in the size of the crystalline domains within the films.

VA pure case of Gerstmann syndrome with a subangular lesion __ The four symptoms composing Gerstmann's syndrome were postulated to result from a common cognitive denominator (Grundsto\u0308rung) by Gerstmann himself. He suggested that it is a disorder of the body schema restricted to the hand and fingers. The existence of a Grundsto\u0308rung has since been contested. Here we suggest that a common psychoneurological factor does exist, but should be related to transformations of mental images rather than to the body schema. A patient (H.P.) was studied, who presented the four symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome in the absence of any other neuropsychological disorders. MRI showed a focal ischaemic lesion, situated subcortically in the inferior part of the left angular gyrus and reaching the superior posterior region of T1. The cortical layers were spared and the lesion was seen to extend to the callosal fibres. On the basis of an extensive cognitive investigation, language, praxis, memory and intelligence disorders were excluded. The four remaining symptoms (finger agnosia, agraphia, right\u2013left disorientation and dyscalculia) were investigated thoroughly with the aim of determining any characteristics that they might share. Detailed analyses of the tetrad showed that the impairment was consistently attributable to disorders of a spatial nature. Furthermore, cognitive tests necessitating mental rotation were equally shown to be impaired, confirming the essentially visuospatial origin of the disturbance. In the light of this report, the common cognitive denominator is hypothesized to be an impairment in mental manipulation of images and not in body schema.

VImaging therapeutic response in human bone marrow using rapid whole\u2010body MRI __ Whole\u2010body imaging of therapeutic response in human bone marrow was achieved without introduced contrast agents using diffusion\u2010weighted echo\u2010planar magnetic resonance imaging of physiologic water. Bone marrow disease was identified relative to the strong overlying signals from water and lipids in other anatomy through selective excitation of the water resonance and generation of image contrast that was dependent upon differential nuclear relaxation times and self\u2010diffusion coefficients. Three\u2010dimensional displays were generated to aid image interpretation. The geometric distortion inherent in echo\u2010planar imaging techniques was minimized through the acquisition of multiple axial slices at up to 12 anatomic stations over the entire body. Examples presented include the evaluation of therapeutic response in bone marrow during cytotoxic therapy for leukemia and metastatic prostate cancer and during cytokine administration for marrow mobilization prior to stem cell harvest.

VTranscranial Doppler ultrasonic assessment of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity changes during verbal and visuospatial cognitive tasks __ Hemisphere specific changes of blood flow velocity in the right and left middle cerebral artery (MCA) induced by cognitive demands of verbal and nonverbal tasks were examined by means of a newly developed technique of simultaneous bilateral transcranial ultrasonic Doppler sonography (TCD). Thirty-one right-handed healthy volunteers served as subjects. Identical stimulus and response procedures were used with all tasks to avoid possible differential effects of these conditions on blood flow velocity. Compared to the preceding resting phase, the increase in flow velocity induced by each of the verbal tasks (sentence completion, similar or contrasting word meanings, similarities) proved to be significantly higher in the left than in the right MCA. Among the non-verbal visuospatial tasks only the \u201cidentical pictures\u201d (perceptual speed) task led to a complementary higher increase in right MCA blood flow velocity. No such asymmetry in blood flow acceleration was observed, however, with the tasks \u201cfigure assembly\u201d and \u201ccube comparison\u201d which require visualization and mental rotation of figures. The findings underline the recently emerging uncertainty in neuropsychological research with regard to the functional specialization of the right hemisphere.

VDevelopment of Three\u2010Dimensional Completion of Complex Objects __ Three\u2010dimensional (3D) object completion, the ability to perceive the backs of objects seen from a single viewpoint, emerges at around 6\u2003months of age. Yet, only relatively simple 3D objects have been used in assessing its development. This study examined infants\u2019 3D object completion when presented with more complex stimuli. Infants (N\u2003=\u200348) were habituated to an \u201cL\u201d\u2010shaped object shown from a limited viewpoint; then they were tested with volumetrically complete (solid) and incomplete (hollow) versions of the object. Four\u2010month\u2010olds and 6\u2010month\u2010old girls had no preference for either display. Six\u2010month\u2010old boys and both sexes at 9.5\u2003months of age showed a novelty preference for the incomplete object. A control group (N\u2003=\u200348), only shown the test displays, had no spontaneous preference. Perceptual completion of complex 3D objects requires infants to integrate multiple, local object features and thus may tax their nascent attentional skills. Infants might use mental rotation to supplement performance, giving an advantage to young boys. Examining the development of perceptual completion of more complex 3D objects reveals distinct mechanisms for the acquisition and refinement of 3D object completion in infancy.

VGirls' spatial abilities: Charting the contributions of experiences and attitudes in different academic groups __ Background: Gender\u2010related differences in spatial abilities favouring males are well established but have also generated a great deal of controversy. Cross\u2010cultural research, meta\u2010analyses and training studies could show the influence of socio\u2010cultural and experiential factors on spatial\u2010test performance. However, little is known about how experiences and gender\u2010role stereotypes mediate performance differences in this area. Aim: The relationship between specific experiences (spatial activities, computer experience), achievement\u2010related attitudes, and spatial abilities, i.e., mental\u2010rotation ability was investigated with males and females in different academic subgroups. Sample: The sample comprised 112 female and 71 male undergraduates, majoring in arts, humanities and social sciences, sports, psychology and computational visualistics. Methods: A redrawn version of the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was administered and the participants completed a questionnaire about their spatial activities, computer experience, self\u2010ratings regarding everyday spatial abilities, and attitudes towards mathematics and physics. Results: Mental Rotations Test performance was mainly affected by academic programme and gender, but the effect size of gender differences varied. It was largest with students majoring in arts, humanities and social sciences and smallest with those majoring in computational visualistics. Data analyses revealed statistically significant correlations with spatial activities and computer experience only for females. The relationship between test performance and scales of achievement\u2010related self\u2010concept also depended on gender. Conclusions: Compared to males, females' spatial abilities are extremely vulnerable to and thus modifiable through attitudinal and experiential factors. This has considerable consequences for intervention programmes that could help to overcome the gender gap in spatial abilities.

VGirls in detail, boys in shape: Gender differences when drawing cubes in depth __ The current study tested gender differences in the developmental transition from drawing cubes in two\u2010 versus three dimensions (3D), and investigated the underlying spatial abilities. Six\u2010 to nine\u2010year\u2010old children (N = 97) drew two occluding model cubes and solved several other spatial tasks. Girls more often unfolded the various sides of the cubes into a layout, also called diagrammatic cube drawing (object design detail). In girls, the best predictor for drawing the cubes was Mental Rotation Test (MRT) accuracy. In contrast, boys were more likely to preserve the optical appearance of the cube array. Their drawing in 3D was best predicted by MRT reaction time and the Embedded Figures Test (EFT). This confirmed boys' stronger focus on the contours of an object silhouette (object shape). It is discussed whether the two gender\u2010specific approaches to drawing in three dimensions reflect two sides of the appearance\u2013reality distinction in drawing, that is graphic syntax of object design features versus visual perception of projective space.

VPrize Proliferation __ Recent decades have been characterized by growing numbers of awards, prizes, and honors distributed by a wide range of social worlds\u2014prize proliferation. This article examines how claims for\u2014and counterclaims against\u2014establishing prizes lead to more awards being given. Unlike most constructionist analyses that explore how centralized claims\u2010making campaigns construct social problems, this study of prize proliferation illustrates how localized, independent social worlds can become arenas for claims, and how such largely unrelated efforts can shape broad social trends.

VPsychometric analysis of the systemizing quotient (SQ) scale __ The psychometric properties of the systemizing quotient (SQ) developed by Baron\u2010Cohen (2003) are investigated in three studies. Furthermore, we examine the notion that the ability to systemize should be independent of intelligence. In Studies 1 and 2, confirmatory factor analyses are used to examine the factor structure of the SQ. Study 3 examines the relationship between systemizing, mental rotation and intelligence. Studies 1 and 2 indicate that the SQ does not possess a unifactorial structure but is best considered as four related factors; Study 3 found that SQ was not related to intelligence, although mental rotation was. A four factor structure using fewer items was a better fit for the data than either the original version of the SQ or Wakabayashi et al.'s (2006) revised version. Overall these results support Baron\u2010Cohen's view that SQ is not related to intelligence. Although mental rotation is correlated to SQ, it is not the main determinant of SQ. The problems of self\u2010report measures are discussed along with the difficulties related to measuring systemizing.

VSentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with a needle core biopsy diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ: is it justified? __ Background: The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has increased markedly with the introduction of population-based mammographic screening. DCIS is usually diagnosed non-operatively. Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) has become the standard of care for patients with invasive breast carcinoma, its use in patients with DCIS is controversial. Aim: To examine the justification for offering SNB at the time of primary surgery to patients with a needle core biopsy (NCB) diagnosis of DCIS. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 145 patients with an NCB diagnosis of DCIS who had SNB performed at the time of primary surgery. The study focused on rates of SNB positivity and underestimation of invasive carcinoma by NCB, and sought to identify factors that might predict the presence of invasive carcinoma in the excision specimen. Results: 7/145 patients (4.8%) had a positive sentinel lymph node, four macrometastases and three micrometastases. 6/7 patients had invasive carcinoma in the final excision specimen. 55/145 patients (37.9%) with an NCB diagnosis of DCIS had invasive carcinoma in the excision specimen. The median invasive tumour size was 6 mm. A radiological mass and areas of invasion <1 mm, amounting to \u201cat least microinvasion\u201d on NCB were predictive of invasive carcinoma in the excision specimen. Conclusions: SNB positivity in pure DCIS is rare. In view of the high rate of underestimation of invasive carcinoma in patients with an NCB diagnosis of DCIS in this study, SNB appears justified in this group of patients.

VCytochrome P4501A1 induction in Kenai River sculpin ( Cottus spp.) as a monitor of freshwater pollution effects __ Freshwater sculpin were taken from various locations in the Kenai River to determine their in-vivo response to pollution exposure. The specific activity of cytochrome P4501A1 was determined using fluorescence detection of the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) reaction. The EROD specific activity was found to be independent of river miles but appeared to relate to specific sites of urban runoff. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were also measured but showed no significant difference between sites. Cytochrome P450 laboratory induction studies were carried out on individuals collected from a pristine site. Five groups of 10 fish were dosed from 10\u2013150 mg \u03b2-Naphthoftavone (\u03b2NF)/kg body weight. The response was linear from 10\u201350 mg \u03b2NF/kg body weight. Sculpin appear to have excellent potential as a sensitive indicator of xenobiotic exposure in a freshwater benthic habitat.

VTrace element concentrations in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba __ Abstract: Whole Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba collected along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, were analyzed for 14 elements. Average element abundances (in parentheses) in \u03bcg/g, in descending order, were as follows: P(9940), Cu (80.5), Zn (43.5), Fe (28.0), Se (5.80), Ba (3.78), Mn (1.98), As (1.92), Ag (1.71), Ni (0.54), Cr (0.30), Cd (0.29), Pb (0.22), and Hg (0.025). Inverse relationships were found between krill length and Hg concentration as well as between As and P levels. A geographic trend of increasing Mn and P levels from southwest to northeast along the Antarctic Peninsula was Sound. Results were compared to earlier data for evidence of metal concentration changes due to anthropogenic activity over the last 15 years.

VEffects of concurrent memory load on visual-field differences in mental rotation __ Normal right-handers mentally rotated letters flashed in the left or right visual fields under different conditions of working-memory load. In Experiment 1, the subjects held patterns of eight dots or sequences of eight letters in working memory, and these conditions produced a progressively increasing right visual field (RVF) advantage in rate of mental rotation relative to a control condition in which there was no load. Experiment 2 confirmed the shift toward increasing RVF advantage with a load of eight digits relative to two control conditions, one in which there was no load and another in which the subjects recalled digits before carrying out the mental rotation on each trial. These results are discussed in terms of the priming of the hemispheres by the concurrent loading of working memory.

VResolving mixtures of strategies in spatial visualization tasks __ The models of standard test theory, having evolved under a trait\u2010oriented psychology, do not reflect the knowledge structures and the problem\u2010solving strategies now seen as central to understanding performance and learning. In some applications, however, key qualitative distinctions among persons as to structures and strategies can be expressed through mixtures of test theory models, drawing on substantive theory to delineate the components of the mixture. This approach is illustrated with response latencies to spatial visualization tasks that can be solved by mental rotation or by a non\u2010rotational rule\u2010based strategy. It is assumed that a subject employs the same strategy on all tasks, but the possibility of extending the approach to strategy\u2010switching is discussed.

VMigration and technical efficiency in cereal production: evidence from Burkina Faso __ This article uses a double bootstrap procedure and survey data from Burkina Faso in a two\u2010stage estimation to explore ways in which continental and intercontinental migration determine efficiency in cereal production of rural households. Findings suggest that continental migration has a positive relation and intercontinental migration no relation with technical efficiency. For continental migrant households, migration has removed surplus male labor, a cause for inefficiency in production. Intercontinental migration leads to a gender imbalance in the household, which cannot be compensated for by investments in farm equipment. The failure of intercontinental migration to transform cereal production from traditional to modern is attributed to an imperfect market environment.

VSpatiotemporal organization of brain dynamics and intelligence: an EEG study in adolescents __ This study investigated relationships between global dynamics of brain electric activity and intelligence. EEG was recorded monopolarly from 10 symmetric leads (10\u201320 system) in 37 (17 males) healthy subjects (mean age 13.7 years) at rest and during performance of two visually presented cognitive tasks, verbal (semantic grouping) and spatial (mental rotation). On another occasion, the subjects were administered the Intelligence Structure Test (IST). Both total IST score and some individual subtests of specific abilities showed significant positive correlations with EEG coherence in the theta band and significant negative relationships with EEG dimension, a measure of complexity and unpredictability of neural oscillatory dynamics underlying the EEG time series. Furthermore, EEG coherence and dimensional complexity were inversely related. Taken together, these EEG metrics accounted for over 30% of the variability of the total IST score in this sample. No significant effects of the task type (spatial vs. verbal) or specific abilities were observed. Long-distance theta coherence between frontal and parieto-occipital areas showed the most consistent relationship with cognitive abilities. The results suggest that order to chaos ratio in task-related brain dynamics may be one of the biological factors underlying individual differences in cognitive abilities in adolescents.

VThe affective underpinnings of psychological contract fulfilment __ Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an empirical study of the link between psychological contract fulfilment and affective states at work. The paper argues that perceived organizational support is the key attitudinal intervening variable that arises from the cognitive assessment of the exchange relationship between employer and employee and is in turn related to the generation of affective states at work. Designmethodologyapproach The paper tests this assumption using a manager sample of 249 participants and a longitudinal design. Findings Perceived organizational support mediates the relationship between psychological contract fulfilment and workplace affect. Research limitationsimplications Affect was not measured in real time, but through selfreports. Future research could study how and under what conditions psychological contract fulfilment generates perceived organizational support. Originalityvalue One of the few studies that have sought to research the affective dimension of the psychological contract.

VManagerial hedging, equity ownership, and firm value __ Suppose risk\u2010averse managers can hedge the aggregate component of their exposure to firm's cash\u2010flow risk by trading in financial markets but cannot hedge their firm\u2010specific exposure. This gives them incentives to pass up firm\u2010specific projects in favor of standard projects that contain greater aggregate risk. Such forms of moral hazard give rise to excessive aggregate risk in stock markets. In this context, optimal managerial contracts induce a relationship between managerial ownership and (i) aggregate risk in the firm's cash flows, as well as (ii) firm value. We show that this can help explain the shape of the empirically documented relationship between ownership and firm performance.

Let at(t \u2a7e 0) be a nondecreasing function of t with 0 < at \u2a7d t.

On the contrary, if lim infk \u2192 \u221e {(tk+1 \u2212 tk)/atk} \u2a7e 1, then we have a value \u03b4 almost surely, where \u03b4=inf{\u03b3>;\u2211(tk(log(n)tk)/atk)\u2212\u03b32<\u221e}, n\u2a7d1.

VEffects of chronic absorption of dietary supplements of methionine and cystine on arterial morphology in the rat __ Male Wistar rats were fed diets containing supplements of either methionine or cystine from 10 weeks of age and compared to rats fed a control diet or a high protein diet kept under identical conditions. At 11\u201316 months of age, the aorta and the renal, iliac and caudal arteries of all rats were fixed and examined by light and electron microscopy. Cystine-fed rats showed arterial morphology similar to that of control rats and of those having received a high protein diet. Methionine-fed rats showed marked thickening of the arterial wall which was due, on the one hand, to massive intimal thickening, as a result of accumulation of granular material in the subendothelial region and, on the other hand, to marked thickening of the media as a result of increased extracellular material around smooth muscle cells. Zones of early phases of chondroid metaplasia were also observed in the media. Thus cystine and methionine, despite their interrelated metabolism, have very different effects on the morphology of the arterial wall. However, cystine and methionine both inhibited the spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the renal artery. This latter result is discussed in the light of the similarities between spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile-induced aortic aneurysm and rupture.

VThe structure and activity of membrane receptors: computational simulation of histamine H2-receptor activation __ A three dimensional molecular model of the transmembrane domain of the Histamine H2-receptor was constructed, by computer-aided model building techniques, based on the amino acid sequence; topological criteria guided by inferences from sequence homologies; the electron density projection map of bovine Rhodopsin obtained from electron microscopy; prediction of helix-helix interactions; experimental results from site-directed mutagenesis; and quantum mechanical calculations. In this model, the binding of Histamine to the receptor consists of: i) the ionic interaction between the protonated side chain amine and the conserved Asp98, located in transmembrane helix (TMH) 3; ii) the hydrogen bond between the N(3)\ue5f8H moiety of the imidazole ring and the non conserved Asp186, located in TMH 5; iii) the hydrogen bond between the N(1) atom of the imidazole ring and the non conserved Arg257, located in TMH 6. The activation mechanism of the receptor resulting from ligand binding takes the form of a proton transfer from TMH 6 (Arg257) to TMH 5 (Asp186). This process explains the local changes induced by agonist in the receptor binding site. The structural consequences of these changes could mediate the propagation of the extracellular signal, encoded in the structure of the ligand, to the intracellular site.

VMarriage Rituals as Reinforcers of Role Transitions: An Analysis of Weddings in The Netherlands __ Using a nationally representative survey of married couples (N\u2003=\u2003572) in The Netherlands, I analyze three characteristics of the contemporary western marriage ceremony: (a) whether couples give a wedding party, (b) whether couples have their marriage consecrated in church, and (c) whether couples go away on a honeymoon. Hypotheses are developed arguing that marriage ceremonies reinforce role transitions in two complementary ways: They reduce uncertainty about the new roles that people will occupy, and they provide approval for norm\u2010guided behavior. Multivariate analyses support the hypotheses. Elaborate marriage ceremonies are more common among couples for whom the transition to marriage is more drastic, and traditional values in the social context of the couple go hand in hand with a more elaborate marriage ceremony.

VSpinal cord protection during aortic cross-clamping using retrograde venous perfusion __ Background. Paraplegia remains a devastating complication following thoracic aortic operation. We hypothesized that retrograde perfusion of the spinal cord with a hypothermic, adenosine-enhanced solution would provide protection during periods of ischemia due to temporary aortic occlusion.Methods. In a rabbit model, a 45-minute period of spinal cord ischemia was produced by clamping the abdominal aorta and vena cava just below the left renal vessels and at their bifurcations. Four groups (n = 8/group) were studied: control, warm saline, cold saline, and cold saline with adenosine infusion. In the experimental groups, saline or saline plus adenosine was infused into the isolated cavae throughout the ischemic period. Clamps were removed and the animals to recovered for 24 hours before blinded neurological evaluation.Results. Tarlov scores (0 = paraplegia, 1 = slight movement, 2 = sits with assistance, 3 = sits alone, 4 = weak hop, 5 = normal hop) were (mean ± standard error of the mean): control, 0.50 ± 0.50; warm saline, 1.63 ± 0.56; cold saline, 3.38 ± 0.26; and cold saline plus adenosine, 4.25 ± 0.16 (analysis of variance for all four groups, p < 0.00001). Post-hoc contrast analysis showed that cold saline plus adenosine was superior to the other three groups (p < 0.0001).Conclusion. Retrograde venous perfusion of the spinal cord with hypothermic saline and adenosine provides functional protection against surgical ischemia and reperfusion.

VChanges in cortical activity during mental rotation A mapping study using functional MRI __ Mental imagery is an important cognitive method for problem solving, and the mental rotation of complex objects, as originally described by Shepard and Metzler (1971), is among the best studied of mental imagery tasks. Functional MRI was used to observe focal changes in blood flow in the brains of 10 healthy volunteers performing a mental rotation task. On each trial, subjects viewed a pair of perspective drawings of three-dimensional shapes, mentally rotated one into congruence with the other, and then determined whether the two forms were identical or mirror-images. The control task, which we have called the \u2018comparison\u2019 condition, was identical except that both members of each pair appeared at the same orientation, and hence the same encoding, comparison and decision processes were used but mental rotation was not required. These tasks were interleaved with a baseline \u2018fixation\u2019 condition, in which the subjects viewed a crosshair. Technically adequate studies were obtained in eight of the 10 subjects. Areas of increased signal were identified according to sulcal landmarks and are described in terms of the Brodmann's area (BA) definitions that correspond according to the atlas of Talaraich and Tournoux. When the rotation task was contrasted with the comparison condition, all subjects showed consistent foci of activation in BAs 7a and 7b (sometimes spreading to BA 40); 88% had increased signal in middle frontal gyrus (BA 8) and 75% showed extrastriate activation, including particularly BAs 39 and 19, in a position consistent with area V5/human MT as localized by functional and histological assays. In more than half of the subjects, hand somatosensory cortex (3-1-2) was engaged, and in 50% of subjects there was elevated signal in BA 18. In frontal cortex, activation was above threshold in half the subjects in BAs 9 and/or 46 (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Some (four out of eight) subjects also showed signal increases in BAs 44 and/or 46. Premotor cortex (BA 6) was active in half of the subjects during the rotation task. There was little evidence for lateralization of the cortical activity or of engagement of motor cortex. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mental rotation engages cortical areas involved in tracking moving objects and encoding spatial relations, as well as the more general understanding that mental imagery engages the same, or similar, neural imagery as direct perception.

VMental rotation in perspective problems __ The present paper demostrates that mental rotation as used in the processing of disoriented objects (Cooper and Shepard 1973) can also be used as an explanatory concept for the processing of perspective problems in which the task is to imagine how an environment will appear from another vantage point. In a cognitive map, subjects imagined an initial line of vision and subsequently processed a reorientation stimulus, requesting them to imagine a turn over 0, 45, 90, 135, or 180 degrees. Time for a reorientation increased linearly with the size of the imaginary turn up to 135° and decreased for turns of 180°; apparently, about-faces were relatively easy to imagine. The increment of reorientation time between 0 and 135° was larger for maps presented in unfamiliar orientations such as South-West up. Both the increment and the interaction with familiarity are consistent with an explanation in terms of mental rotation.

VRemote endarterectomy in SFA occlusive disease __ The authors present a new modified endarterectomy technique for the treatment of artherosclerotic occlusive disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA). The SFA remote endarterectomy procedure can be performed through a single groin incision using a ring strip cutter and stenting the distal endpoint. Complete disobliteration of lengthy occlusions was accomplished in more than 100 cases with a cumulative 2-year primary and assisted primary patency rate of 71 and 86%. The mean length of the removed intima core was 33 (10\u201345) cm. The endovascular remote endarterectomy technique is explained and depicted in detail and some important questions and controversies are discussed.

VEarly Education for Spatial Intelligence: Why, What, and How __ Spatial representation and thinking have evolutionary importance for any mobile organism. In addition, they help reasoning in domains that are not obviously spatial, for example, through the use of graphs and diagrams. This article reviews the literature suggesting that mental spatial transformation abilities, while present in some precursory form in infants, toddlers, and preschool children, also undergo considerable development and show important individual differences, which are malleable. These findings provide the basis for thinking about how to promote spatial thinking in preschools, at home, and in children\u2019s play. Integrating spatial content into formal and informal instruction could not only improve spatial functioning in general but also reduce differences related to gender and socioeconomic status that may impede full participation in a technological society.

VTreatment of Mediastinitis: Early Modified Robicsek Closure and Pectoralis Major Advancement Flaps __ Background. The treatment of sternal wound complications is controversial. It is our practice to combine early aggressive debridement, a modified Robicsek sternal closure, and bilateral pectoralis major advancement flaps with or without closed irrigation in a single procedure. We reviewed our experience to determine the efficacy of this approach.Methods. Grade II to IV mediastinitis (dehiscence and infection) developed in 47 patients 3 to 14 days after routine open heart operations between 1990 and 1995. Culture-positive infection was identified in 60% (n = 28); 62% (n = 29) had septicemia. Thirty patients underwent incision, drainage, and surgical assessment of the wound. Once systemic signs of infection were under control (no pyrexia, normal white blood cell count), formal single-stage debridement of all infected soft tissues and bones was performed. Sternal stability was achieved using a modified Robicsek closure and bilateral pectoralis major advancement flaps. Seventeen patients were treated with staged procedures.Results. Early sternal closure and coverage with pectoralis major advancement flaps can be associated with a low mortality (0%), low morbidity (13%; n = 4: three superficial wound infections, one seroma), and shortened hospital stay (median, 22 days, compared with a median of 82 days in patients managed with conservative staged treatment; p < 0.05). Sternal stability with excellent functional and aesthetic results has been achieved in all patients.Conclusions. The combination of aggressive early surgical debridement, sternal closure, and the placement of bilateral pectoralis major advancement flaps is a simple procedure associated with a low mortality and morbidity and a short hospital stay.

VSingle\u2010step dyeing and finishing treatment of cotton with 1,2,3,4\u2010butanetetracarboxylic acid __ A single\u2010step dyeing and finishing (SDF) process was developed to eliminate dyeing problems associated with cotton crosslinked by polycarboxylic acid such as 1,2,3,4\u2010butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA). This process consisted of several steps: (a) impregnation of the fabric by the bath containing BTCA, dye, and catalyst; (b) drying; and (c) curing at high temperature. Color strength (K/S) and dye fixation of cotton treated by the SDF process were excellent, especially with reactive dyes containing mono\u2010 or dichlorotriazinyl compounds and, in some cases, were higher than those of the sample dyed by a conventional batch process without finishing treatment. The presence of dye in the SDF process did not interfere with crosslinking of cotton. We believed that the reaction occurred between carboxyl groups of BTCA and s\u2010triazinyl groups in reactive dyes in the presence of imidazole and other catalyst. FTIR, Raman, and X\u2010ray fluorescence spectroscopies were used to confirm the mechanism of dye fixation. Elemental analysis also supported this mechanism. The SDF process can be an excellent way to dye fabric that also requires crosslinking treatment for smooth drying appearance. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

VAn investigation of immune system disorder as a \u201cmarker\u201d for anomalous dominance __ Geschwind and Galaburda (1987) proposed that immune disorder (ID) susceptibility, along with left handedness and familial sinistrality (FS), is a \u201cmarker\u201d for anomalous dominance. The theory predicts lesser left lateralization for language processes, lessened left hemisphere abilities, and enhanced right hemisphere abilities. We assessed language laterality (dichotic consonant vowel task) and performances on spatial and verbal tasks. Subjects were 128 college students. The factors of handedness, sex, FS, and immune disorder history (negative or positive) were perfectly counterbalanced. Left-handers were significantly less lateralized for language and scored lower than right-handers on the spatial tasks. Females scored lower on mental rotation than males, but performed comparably to males on the spatial relations task. The only effect of ID was by way of interaction with FS on both spatial tasks\u2014subjects who were either negative or positive on both FS and ID status factors scored significantly higher than subjects negative for one but positive for the other factor. A speculative explanatory model for this interaction was proposed. The model incorporates the notion that FS and ID factors are comparably correlated, but in opposite directions, with hormonal factors implicated by other research as relevant for spatial ability differences. Finally, no support for the \u201canomalous dominance\u201d hypothesis predictions was found.

VSoft Dimension Reduction for ICA by Joint Diagonalization on the Stiefel Manifold __ Abstract: Joint diagonalization for ICA is often performed on the orthogonal group after a pre-whitening step. Here we assume that we only want to extract a few sources after pre-whitening, and hence work on the Stiefel manifold of p-frames in \u211d n . The resulting method does not only use second-order statistics to estimate the dimension reduction and is therefore denoted as soft dimension reduction. We employ a trust-region method for minimizing the cost function on the Stiefel manifold. Applications to a toy example and functional MRI data show a higher numerical efficiency, especially when p is much smaller than n, and more robust performance in the presence of strong noise than methods based on pre-whitening.

VELAG 95 Report of the library systems seminar on organising the electronic library __ The 19th ELAG European Library Automation Group Library Systems Seminar Organising the electronic library, took place at Trondheim, Norway on June 1416, 1995. The meeting was remarkable in different ways the great number of attendants, the feeling at home of the colleagues from Central and Eastern Europe, the high quality of the programme, the optimal technical infrastructure and support, and last but not least the nice and positive overall ambience during the whole meeting.

VEffects of different forms of antimony on rice during the period of germination and growth and antimony concentration in rice tissue __ Seed germination and pot experiments for rice were conducted to investigate the effects of Sb(III) and Sb(V) on the growth and yield of rice, and the antimony concentration in rice tissue. Antimony was applied either as antimony potassium tartrate (III) or as potassium antimonate (V) in the experiments. The result show that Sb(III) and Sb(V) can affect the growth of root and rice sprout, and reduce the transformation ratio of dry matter during the germination period of rice seed, also, it can affect the activity of \u03b1-amylase and the growth of rice. A reduction in yield and an increase of antimony in rice were significantly related to Sb application rates to soils. The results also suggest that not only the application rate of Sb, but also the chemical form of Sb form should be considered while assessing the effect of Sb on plant and the danger of Sb contamination of soils as well as of food.

VThe Sacred Kingdom and the Royal Wedding of 2011 __ Despite secularisation and increased religious diversity the UK state and the monarchy are religiously legitimated institutions which have their origins in protestant/catholic divisions over three hundred years ago but which remain strong enough to survive in the current era. The Church of England acts not only as the established church of England but as a church for the UK with respect to events such as the coronation and the royal wedding of 2011. Ecumenical and interfaith initiatives have been attempted by the government and the monarchy and were evident in attendance at the wedding but it demonstrated the ritual supremacy of the state church and the inevitable difficulties of seeking to achieve formal representation for religious diversity in the state. Attempts at more formally inclusive religious involvement in state institutions conflict with other goals such as gender equity and suggest that secular state institutions might be fairer to all religions, denominations and those with no beliefs.

VChromatin changes on the GSTP1 promoter associated with its inactivation in prostate cancer __ Glutathione\u2010S\u2010transferases (GSTs) are metabolic enzymes that help detoxify and eliminate harmful chemicals. In prostate tumors, expression of GST \u03c0 (encoded by GSTP1) is frequently lost because of promoter hypermethylation. Here we analyze the native GSTP1 promoter in cancerous and noncancerous human prostate cells to identify structural features associated with its cancer\u2010related transcriptional silencing. We find that in noncancerous prostate cells (RWPE\u20101 and PWR\u20101E) GSTP1 is constitutively expressed, not methylated, highly accessible, bound by transcription factors and associated with histones with activating modifications (histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 and acetylated histones H3 and H4). In contrast, in cancerous prostate cells (LNCaP) GSTP1 is not expressed, extensively methylated, inaccessible, lacks bound transcription factors and is not associated with histones with activating modifications. We do not detect significant levels of histones with repressive modifications (histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 or 27) on GSTP1 in any cell line indicating that they are not associated with cancer\u2010related GSTP1 silencing. Treatment of LNCaP cells with 5\u2010azacytidine restores activating histone modifications on GSTP1 and reactivates transcription. We conclude that, in the process of prostate carcinogenesis, activating histone modifications on GSTP1 are lost and the DNA becomes methylated and inaccessible resulting in transcriptional silencing. © 2007 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.

VA unified theory of autism revisited: linkage evidence points to chromosome X using a high\u2010risk subset of AGRE families __ Zhao et al. [2007] in their \u201cUnified Theory of Autism\u201d hypothesized that incidence of autism in males could be explained by essentially two types of family structures: majority of autism cases are from low\u2010risk autism families with de novo mutations, and a minority of cases are from high\u2010risk multiplex families, where risk to male offspring approximates 50% consistent with a dominant model and high penetrance. Using the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) data set, Zhao et al. identified 86 high\u2010risk families with likely dominant transmission. As genotype data are now available for many members of the AGRE resource, the objective of this manuscript was to determine if dominant linkage evidence for an autism predisposition gene exists in these 86 high\u2010risk families. HumanHap550K Illumina SNP data were available for 92% of 455 total family members in these 86 high\u2010risk families. We performed a linkage analysis using a pruned subset of markers where markers in high linkage disequilibrium were removed. We observed a single suggestive peak (maximum LOD 2.01, maximum HLOD 2.08) under a dominant model on chromosome Xp22.11\u2010p21.2 that encompasses the IL1RAPL1 gene. Mutations or deletions in IL1RAPL1 have been previously reported in three families with autism. In our study, 11 families contributed nominally (P<0.05, HLOD>0.588) to the chromosome X peak. These results demonstrate that identification of a more homogeneous subset of autism cases, which was based on family structure in this study, may help to identify, localize and further our understanding of autism predisposition genes.
